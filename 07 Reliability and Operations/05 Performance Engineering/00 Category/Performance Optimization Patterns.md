# Performance Optimization Patterns

**Back:** [[Performance Engineering]]

Common patterns for improving system performance across caching, connection management, async processing, and data access. These patterns trade complexity (or storage or consistency) for improved latency, throughput, or resource efficiency.

## Concepts

- [[Connection Pooling]]
- [[Async Processing]]
- [[Batch Processing]]
- [[Denormalization]]
- [[Read Replicas]]
- [[Compression]]
- [[Lazy Loading]]
