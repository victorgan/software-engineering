> <- Back to [[Chaos Engineering]]

Deliberately introducing specific failure modes into a system: network partitions, latency injection, disk failure, DNS failure, process crashes, and resource exhaustion. Each failure type tests different aspects of system resilience.

## Key Properties

- [[Network Partition Injection]]
- [[Latency Injection]]
- [[Resource Exhaustion Testing]]
