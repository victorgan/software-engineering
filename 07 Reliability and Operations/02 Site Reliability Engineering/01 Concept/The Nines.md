> <- Back to [[SLAs, SLOs, SLIs]]

A shorthand for availability targets expressed as percentages of uptime. 99.9% ("three nines") allows 8.76 hours of downtime per year. 99.99% ("four nines") allows 52.6 minutes per year. Each additional nine requires roughly 10x the engineering investment.

## Key Properties

- [[Downtime Budget Calculation]]
- [[Cost of Additional Nines]]
- [[Diminishing Returns]]
