# Redundancy

> <- Back to [[Reliability Patterns]]

Eliminating single points of failure through duplication of critical components. Multi-AZ deployments survive data center failures, multi-region deployments survive regional outages. Redundancy is the foundation of high availability but increases cost and operational complexity.

## Key Properties

- [[Multi-AZ Deployment]]
- [[Multi-Region Deployment]]
- [[N+1 Redundancy]]
