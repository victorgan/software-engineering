# Error Budget Concept

> <- Back to [[Error Budgets]]

The allowed unreliability of a service, calculated as 1 minus the SLO target. A 99.9% SLO means a 0.1% error budget. This reframes reliability as a finite resource that can be "spent" on deployments, experiments, and migrations, creating a shared framework between product and SRE teams.

## Key Properties

- [[Budget Calculation]]
- [[Budget as Currency]]
