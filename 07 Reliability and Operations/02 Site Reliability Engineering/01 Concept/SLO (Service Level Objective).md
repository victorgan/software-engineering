# SLO (Service Level Objective)

> <- Back to [[SLAs, SLOs, SLIs]]

A target value or range for an SLI that defines acceptable service behavior. For example, "99.9% of requests complete in under 200ms." SLOs should be based on user expectations, not technical capability, and should be the primary driver of reliability decisions.
