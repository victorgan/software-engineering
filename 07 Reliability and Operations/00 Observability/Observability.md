# Observability

**Back:** [[07 - Reliability and Operations MOC]]

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its external outputs. Built on the three pillars of logs, metrics, and traces, observability enables teams to debug production issues, understand system behavior, and proactively detect problems before they impact users.
