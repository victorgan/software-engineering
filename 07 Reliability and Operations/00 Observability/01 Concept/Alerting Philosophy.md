# Alerting Philosophy

> <- Back to [[Dashboards and Alerting]]

Alert on symptoms not causes, reduce noise, and ensure every alert is actionable. Good alerts tell the on-call engineer what is broken and what to do, not just that a metric crossed a threshold. The goal is to detect user-impacting issues, not internal implementation details.

## Key Properties

- [[Symptom-Based Alerting]]
