> <- Back to [[Logging]]

Logging a percentage of events to manage volume at scale. When systems generate millions of log entries per second, sampling reduces storage and processing costs while still providing statistically meaningful visibility into system behavior.

## Key Properties

- [[Sample Rate Selection]]
- [[Priority-Based Sampling]]
- [[Cost vs Visibility Tradeoff]]
