# Trace Sampling

> <- Back to [[Distributed Tracing]]

Strategies for reducing trace volume while preserving useful data. Head-based sampling decides at request start whether to trace, while tail-based sampling decides after the request completes (capturing all errors and slow requests regardless of sample rate).

## Key Properties

- [[Head-Based Sampling]]
- [[Tail-Based Sampling]]
- [[Adaptive Sampling]]
