# Tail Latency

> <- Back to [[Percentiles]]

The latency experienced by the slowest requests (p99, p99.9). In distributed systems, tail latency is amplified because a single slow component slows the entire request. Averages hide tail latency, making percentiles essential for understanding real user experience.
