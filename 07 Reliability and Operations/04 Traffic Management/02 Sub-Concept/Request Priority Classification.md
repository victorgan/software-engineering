# Request Priority Classification

> <- Back to [[Priority-Based Shedding]]

Categorizing requests by business importance to determine shedding order. Critical requests (purchases, payments) are shed last, while background tasks (analytics, recommendations) are shed first. Classification can be done by endpoint, user tier, or request metadata.
