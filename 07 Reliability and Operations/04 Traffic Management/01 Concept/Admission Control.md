# Admission Control

> <- Back to [[Load Shedding]]

Rejecting requests early at the edge when the system is at capacity, rather than accepting them and failing deeper in the stack. Early rejection returns fast errors to clients, prevents resource exhaustion, and maintains service quality for admitted requests.

## Key Properties

- [[Early Rejection]]
- [[Capacity-Based Thresholds]]
- [[Client Retry Behavior]]
