# Disaster Recovery Tiers

**Back:** [[Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity]]

A spectrum of DR strategies from cheapest and slowest (backup and restore) to most expensive and fastest (multi-site active-active). Each tier represents a different tradeoff between cost, recovery time, and data loss tolerance.

## Concepts

- [[DR Tier - Backup and Restore]]
- [[DR Tier - Pilot Light]]
