# RPO (Recovery Point Objective)

> <- Back to [[Backup and Restore]]

The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. An RPO of 1 hour means you can tolerate losing up to 1 hour of data. RPO drives backup frequency: a 5-minute RPO requires near-continuous replication, while a 24-hour RPO may only need daily backups.
