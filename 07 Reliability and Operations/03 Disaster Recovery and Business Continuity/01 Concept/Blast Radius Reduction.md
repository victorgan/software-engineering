> <- Back to [[Business Continuity]]

Architectural patterns that limit the impact of failures to a small portion of users or services. Cell-based architecture, shuffle sharding, and failure domain isolation ensure that a single failure cannot take down the entire system.

## Key Properties

- [[Cell-Based Architecture]]
- [[Shuffle Sharding]]
- [[Failure Domain Isolation]]
