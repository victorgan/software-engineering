# RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

> <- Back to [[Backup and Restore]]

The maximum acceptable duration of downtime after a disaster. An RTO of 4 hours means the system must be restored within 4 hours. RTO drives the choice of DR strategy: shorter RTOs require more expensive always-on standby infrastructure.
