# Concurrency

**Back:** [[02 - Programming Languages and Paradigms MOC]]

Concurrency is about managing multiple computations that may overlap in time. It encompasses threading, synchronization, lock-free programming, and higher-level models like actors and async/await. Correct concurrent programming requires understanding race conditions, deadlocks, memory ordering, and the tradeoffs between different concurrency abstractions.
