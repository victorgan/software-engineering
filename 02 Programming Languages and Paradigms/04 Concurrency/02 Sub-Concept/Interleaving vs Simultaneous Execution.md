# Interleaving vs Simultaneous Execution

> <- Back to [[Concurrency vs Parallelism (Fundamentals)]]

Concurrency interleaves tasks on one or more cores through time-slicing, giving the appearance of simultaneous execution. Parallelism actually runs tasks at the same instant on multiple cores. A program can be concurrent without being parallel (single-core multitasking).
