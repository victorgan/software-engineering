# Backpressure

> <- Back to [[Reactive Programming]]

A mechanism for consumers to signal producers to slow down when they cannot keep up with the rate of incoming data. Without backpressure, fast producers overwhelm slow consumers, causing buffer overflow or out-of-memory errors. Reactive Streams specification standardizes backpressure in JVM libraries.
