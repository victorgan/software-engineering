# Goroutines and core.async

> <- Back to [[CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)]]

Go's goroutines are lightweight user-space threads that communicate via channels, implementing CSP. Clojure's core.async provides similar channel-based concurrency on the JVM. Both enable structuring concurrent programs around sequential processes connected by channels.
