# Vectorized Operations

> <- Back to [[SIMD]]

Transforming scalar operations into SIMD operations that process multiple data elements per instruction. Auto-vectorization by compilers can detect vectorizable loops, but explicit SIMD intrinsics or libraries provide more control for performance-critical code.
