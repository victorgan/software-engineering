# Concurrency Models

**Back:** [[Concurrency]]

Higher-level abstractions for structuring concurrent programs. Each model provides a different way to think about and manage concurrent computation, from shared-memory threads to message-passing actors to cooperative async/await patterns.

## Concepts

- [[Threads & Shared Memory]]
- [[Actor Model]]
- [[CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)]]
- [[Software Transactional Memory (STM)]]
- [[Futures & Promises]]
- [[Async-Await]]
- [[Green Threads - Fibers]]
- [[Reactive Programming]]
