# Synchronization Primitives

**Back:** [[Concurrency]]

Low-level building blocks for coordinating access to shared resources between threads. These primitives ensure mutual exclusion, ordering, and signaling, forming the foundation upon which higher-level concurrency abstractions are built.

## Concepts

- [[Mutexes - Locks]]
- [[Read-Write Locks]]
- [[Semaphores]]
- [[Monitors]]
- [[Condition Variables]]
- [[Barriers]]
- [[Spinlocks]]
