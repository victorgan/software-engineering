# Deadlocks & Livelocks

**Back:** [[Concurrency]]

Deadlocks occur when threads are permanently blocked waiting on each other, while livelocks involve threads actively executing but unable to advance. Understanding the conditions and prevention strategies is critical for reliable concurrent systems.
