# Python Concurrency

> <- Back to [[Language-Specific Concurrency]]

Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism for CPU-bound code in CPython. Multiprocessing bypasses the GIL using separate processes for CPU-bound work. Asyncio provides efficient cooperative multitasking for I/O-bound workloads.

## Key Properties

- [[GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)]]
- [[Multiprocessing for CPU-bound]]
- [[Asyncio for I/O-bound]]
