# Producer-Consumer

> <- Back to [[Concurrency Hazards & Patterns]]

A pattern where producer threads generate work items and place them in a shared bounded buffer, while consumer threads take items from the buffer and process them. A blocking queue provides the synchronization, decoupling production rate from consumption rate.

## Key Properties

- [[Bounded Buffer]]
- [[Blocking Queue Coordination]]
