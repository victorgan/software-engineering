# Deadlock Conditions

> <- Back to [[Deadlocks & Livelocks]]

Four conditions that must all hold simultaneously for deadlock to occur: mutual exclusion (resources cannot be shared), hold-and-wait (threads hold resources while requesting others), no preemption (resources cannot be forcibly taken), and circular wait (a cycle of threads waiting on each other).

## Key Properties
