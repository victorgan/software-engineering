# Go Concurrency

> <- Back to [[Language-Specific Concurrency]]

Go's concurrency model is built on goroutines (lightweight green threads) and channels (typed CSP-style communication). The `select` statement multiplexes over multiple channels. Go's motto is "share memory by communicating" rather than communicating by sharing memory.

## Key Properties

- [[Goroutines and Channels]]
- [[Select Statement]]
