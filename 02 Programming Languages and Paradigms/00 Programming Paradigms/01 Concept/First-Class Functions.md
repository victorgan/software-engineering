> <- Back to [[Functional Programming]]

Functions treated as values that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This enables higher-order functions that take or return functions, forming the basis for powerful abstractions like map, filter, and reduce.

## Key Properties

- [[Functions as Values]]
- [[Higher-Order Functions]]
