# Monads & Functors

> <- Back to [[Functional Programming]]

Abstractions from category theory that provide a structured way to handle computations with context. Functors allow mapping over wrapped values, while monads enable chaining computations that produce wrapped results, managing effects like nullability, errors, and I/O in a pure functional way.

## Key Properties

- [[Option-Maybe]]
- [[Result-Either]]
- [[IO Monad]]
- [[Do-Notation]]
