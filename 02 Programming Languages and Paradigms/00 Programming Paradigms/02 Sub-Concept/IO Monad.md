# IO Monad

> <- Back to [[Monads & Functors]]

A monad that encapsulates side effects (file I/O, network, console) as values that can be composed. In Haskell, the IO monad separates pure computation from effectful operations, maintaining referential transparency while allowing real-world interaction.
