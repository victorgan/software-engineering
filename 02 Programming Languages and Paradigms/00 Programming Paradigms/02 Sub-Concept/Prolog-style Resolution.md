# Prolog-style Resolution

> <- Back to [[Backtracking Search]]

Prolog uses SLD resolution with depth-first search and backtracking. When a goal fails, the system backtracks to the most recent choice point and tries the next alternative, systematically exploring the search space until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
