# Internal vs External DSLs

> <- Back to [[DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages)]]

Internal DSLs are built within a host language using its syntax (e.g., RSpec in Ruby, Gradle in Groovy), leveraging existing tooling. External DSLs have their own syntax and parser (e.g., SQL, CSS, regex), providing maximum expressiveness but requiring dedicated tooling.
