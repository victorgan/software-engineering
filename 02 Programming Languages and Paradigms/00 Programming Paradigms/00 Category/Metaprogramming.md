# Metaprogramming

**Back:** [[Programming Paradigms]]

Programs that treat other programs (or themselves) as data. Metaprogramming enables code generation, compile-time computation, reflection, and the creation of domain-specific languages, providing powerful abstractions at the cost of complexity.

## Concepts

- [[Reflection]]
- [[Macros]]
- [[Code Generation]]
- [[DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages)]]
