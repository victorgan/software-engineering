# Pratt Parsing

> <- Back to [[Operator Precedence Parsing]]

A top-down operator precedence parsing technique invented by Vaughan Pratt. Pratt parsing elegantly handles infix, prefix, and postfix operators with varying precedence and associativity. It is simpler than traditional approaches and used in many real-world parsers.
