# Three-Address Code

> <- Back to [[Intermediate Representation (IR)]]

An IR format where each instruction has at most three operands (two sources and one destination), such as `t1 = a + b`. Three-address code breaks complex expressions into simple operations, making optimization and code generation straightforward.
