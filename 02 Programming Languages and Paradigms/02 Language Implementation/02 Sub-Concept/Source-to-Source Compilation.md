# Source-to-Source Compilation

> <- Back to [[Transpilation]]

Translating code from one high-level language to another, rather than to machine code or bytecode. TypeScript to JavaScript, CoffeeScript to JavaScript, and Babel (modern JS to older JS) are common examples. Enables language innovation while targeting established runtimes.
