# Composable Parsing Functions

> <- Back to [[Parser Combinators]]

Small parsing functions combined using operators like sequence (>>), alternative (|), and repetition (many). Libraries like Parsec (Haskell), nom (Rust), and fparsec (F#) provide combinators that compose into complex parsers while maintaining readability.
