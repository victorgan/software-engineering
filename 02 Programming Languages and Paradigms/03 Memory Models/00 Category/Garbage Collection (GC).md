# Garbage Collection (GC)

**Back:** [[Memory Models]]

Automatic memory management that reclaims memory no longer in use by the program. Different GC algorithms offer tradeoffs between throughput, latency (pause times), memory overhead, and implementation complexity.

## Concepts

- [[Mark-and-Sweep]]
- [[Generational GC]]
- [[Concurrent GC]]
- [[Reference Counting]]
- [[Cycle Detection]]
- [[GC Tuning]]
