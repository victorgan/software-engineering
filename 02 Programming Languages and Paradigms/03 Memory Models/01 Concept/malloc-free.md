# malloc-free

> <- Back to [[Manual Memory Management]]

C-style explicit memory allocation and deallocation. `malloc()` requests a block of memory from the heap and `free()` returns it. The programmer is fully responsible for matching every allocation with a deallocation, and for not using memory after freeing it.
