# Cache Hierarchy

> <- Back to [[Memory Layout]]

Multiple levels of progressively larger and slower caches (L1, L2, L3) between the CPU and main memory. Understanding cache lines, spatial locality (nearby accesses), and temporal locality (repeated accesses) is essential for writing high-performance code.

- [[L1-L2-L3 Caches]]
- [[Cache Lines]]
- [[Spatial and Temporal Locality]]
