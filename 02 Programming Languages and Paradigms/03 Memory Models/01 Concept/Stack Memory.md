# Stack Memory

> <- Back to [[Stack vs Heap]]

Fast, LIFO (Last In, First Out) memory region for automatic allocation. Each function call creates a stack frame holding local variables, parameters, and return addresses. Stack allocation is extremely fast (just a pointer bump) but limited in size and scope.

## Key Properties

- [[Fast LIFO Allocation]]
- [[Function Call Frames]]
- [[Limited Size]]
