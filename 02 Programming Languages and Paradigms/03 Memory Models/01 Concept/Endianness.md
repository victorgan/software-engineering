# Endianness

> <- Back to [[Memory Layout]]

The byte ordering convention for multi-byte values in memory. Big-endian stores the most significant byte at the lowest address; little-endian stores the least significant byte first. Endianness matters for network protocols, file formats, and cross-platform data exchange.
