# Generics - Parametric Polymorphism

> <- Back to [[Advanced Type Features]]

Types and functions parameterized by other types, enabling code that works uniformly across different types. Generics provide type safety while avoiding code duplication through type parameters, bounded types, and variance annotations.

## Key Properties

- [[Type Parameters]]
- [[Bounded Types]]
- [[Variance]]
