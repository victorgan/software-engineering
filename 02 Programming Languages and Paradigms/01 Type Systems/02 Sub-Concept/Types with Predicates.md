# Types with Predicates

> <- Back to [[Refinement Types]]

Types constrained by logical predicates that restrict the set of valid values. For example, `{ x: Int | x > 0 }` represents positive integers. Refinement types can verify properties like non-emptiness, bounds, and sortedness at compile time using SMT solvers.
