# Fully Inferred Types

> <- Back to [[Hindley-Milner]]

The type system can determine the types of all expressions without any programmer-supplied annotations. The Hindley-Milner algorithm computes the principal (most general) type for each expression, providing complete type safety with zero annotation overhead.
