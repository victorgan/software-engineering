# Implicit Conversions Allowed

> <- Back to [[Weak Typing]]

The language automatically converts values between types when needed. For example, JavaScript converts `"5" - 3` to `2` (string to number) but `"5" + 3` to `"53"` (number to string). This convenience can lead to subtle, hard-to-diagnose bugs.
