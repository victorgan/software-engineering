# Types That Depend on Values

> <- Back to [[Dependent Types]]

Types parameterized by runtime values, not just other types. For example, `Vector n Int` is a vector of exactly `n` integers, where `n` is a value. This allows encoding invariants like array bounds, protocol states, and resource linearity directly in the type system.
