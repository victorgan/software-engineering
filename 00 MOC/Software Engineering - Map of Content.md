## 🧬 Ontology

This vault organizes knowledge at four levels of specificity. Each MOC follows this hierarchy:

| Level | Term | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Domain** | Broadest subject area. Each numbered section is a domain. | Data Structures |
| 2 | **Category** | A grouping within a domain. Represented as H2/H3 headings in MOCs. | Linear Structures |
| 3 | **Concept** | A specific, nameable thing. The bolded terms in bullet points. | Arrays |
| 4 | **Sub-Concept** | A variant, detail, or sub-topic within a concept. The descriptions after the em dash. | contiguous memory, O(1) random access, B-Trees, DAGs |

**Domain → Category → Concept → Sub-Concept**

This terminology comes from ontology (knowledge representation). Alternate terms you may encounter:
- Domain = field, discipline
- Category = class, subclass, subdivision
- Concept = topic, entity
- Sub-Concept = variant, detail, attribute, facet
