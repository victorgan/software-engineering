# CAP Theorem (Architecture)

> <- Back to [[Consistency vs Availability]]

In a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of three: Consistency (every read returns the most recent write), Availability (every request gets a response), Partition tolerance (system works despite network failures). Since partitions are inevitable, the real choice is between CP and AP.
