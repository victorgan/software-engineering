# Monolith vs Microservices Decision

> <- Back to [[When to Choose What]]

Choose monolith for small teams (<10 engineers), early-stage products, unclear domain boundaries, and need to ship fast. Choose microservices for large organizations, well-understood domains, independent scaling needs, and polyglot requirements. Modular monolith offers a middle ground.
