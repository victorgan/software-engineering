# Structural Patterns

**Back:** [[Design Patterns]]

Patterns that deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure does not need to change.

## Concepts

- [[Adapter]]
- [[Decorator]]
- [[Facade]]
- [[Proxy]]
- [[Composite]]
- [[Bridge]]
- [[Flyweight]]
