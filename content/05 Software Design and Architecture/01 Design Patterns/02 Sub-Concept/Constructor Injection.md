# Constructor Injection

> <- Back to [[Dependency Injection]]

Dependencies are provided through the constructor, making them explicit and required. This is the most common and preferred form of DI because it makes dependencies visible in the class signature and ensures the object is fully initialized.

#property #dependency-injection #constructor
