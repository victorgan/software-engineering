# Command

> <- Back to [[Behavioral Patterns]]

Encapsulate requests as objects, enabling undo/redo. Turn a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This enables parameterizing methods with different requests, queuing requests, and supporting undoable operations.

## Key Properties

- [[Command Object]]
- [[Invoker and Receiver]]
- [[Undo and Redo]]

## Related

- [[Memento]] (store state for undo)
- [[Chain of Responsibility]] (route commands)
- [[Strategy]] (similar encapsulation, different purpose)
