# Decorator

> <- Back to [[Structural Patterns]]

Add behavior dynamically without modifying class. Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Decorators wrap the original object and delegate to it.

## Key Properties

- [[Wrapping Delegation]]
- [[Stackable Behaviors]]
- [[Interface Conformance]]

## Related

- [[Proxy]] (controls access, decorator adds behavior)
- [[Composition vs Inheritance]] (decorator uses composition)
- [[Middleware Pipeline]] (chain of decorators)
