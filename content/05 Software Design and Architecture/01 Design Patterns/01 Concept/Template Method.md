# Template Method

> <- Back to [[Behavioral Patterns]]

Define algorithm skeleton, let subclasses fill steps. Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Subclasses can redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Key Properties

- [[Algorithm Skeleton]]
- [[Hook Methods]]
- [[Invariant Steps]]

## Related

- [[Strategy]] (delegation vs inheritance)
- [[Factory Method]] (template method for creation)
