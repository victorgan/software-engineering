# Monad Pattern

> <- Back to [[Modern and Functional Patterns]]

Composable computation chains. A design pattern from functional programming that allows structuring programs as sequences of computations while handling side effects, errors, or asynchronous operations in a composable way. Examples include Promise/Future, Option/Maybe, and Result/Either.

## Key Properties

- [[Bind and Return]]
- [[Chaining Operations]]
- [[Side Effect Management]]

## Related

- [[Result and Option Types]] (specific monads)
- [[Middleware Pipeline]] (similar sequential composition)
