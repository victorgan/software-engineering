# Mediator

> <- Back to [[Behavioral Patterns]]

Centralize complex communications between objects. Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and lets you vary their interaction independently.

## Key Properties

- [[Colleague Objects]]
- [[Centralized Communication]]
- [[Reduced Dependencies]]

## Related

- [[Observer]] (distributed notification vs centralized)
- [[Facade]] (simplifies interface to subsystem)
