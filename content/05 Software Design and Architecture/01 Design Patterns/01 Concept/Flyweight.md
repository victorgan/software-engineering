# Flyweight

> <- Back to [[Structural Patterns]]

Share common state to reduce memory. Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. Separates intrinsic state (shared) from extrinsic state (context-dependent, passed in by client).

## Key Properties

- [[Intrinsic vs Extrinsic State]]
- [[Flyweight Factory]]
- [[Object Pooling]]

## Related

- [[Singleton]] (one instance, flyweight many shared instances)
- [[Prototype]] (copy vs share)
