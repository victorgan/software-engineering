# Entities (DDD)

> <- Back to [[Tactical Design]]

Objects defined by their identity rather than their attributes. Two entities with the same attributes but different identities are different objects. Entities have a lifecycle and their state can change over time.

## Key Properties

- [[Identity]]
- [[Lifecycle]]
- [[Mutability]]

## Related

- [[Value Objects]] (contrast: defined by attributes)
- [[Aggregates]] (entities form aggregates)
