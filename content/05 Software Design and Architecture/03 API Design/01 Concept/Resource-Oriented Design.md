# Resource-Oriented Design

> <- Back to [[REST]]

URLs represent resources, HTTP methods as operations. Resources are nouns (users, orders, products), not verbs. Use GET to read, POST to create, PUT/PATCH to update, DELETE to remove. Proper status codes communicate outcomes.

## Key Properties

- [[Resource Naming]]
- [[HTTP Method Semantics]]
- [[Status Code Usage]]
