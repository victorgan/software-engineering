# Serverless Architecture

> <- Back to [[Other Architectural Styles]]

FaaS plus managed services, event-driven. Applications built from functions triggered by events, with the cloud provider managing server infrastructure. Pay-per-invocation pricing, automatic scaling, but with cold start latency and vendor lock-in tradeoffs.

## Key Properties

- [[Function as a Service]]
- [[Event Triggers]]
- [[Pay Per Use]]
