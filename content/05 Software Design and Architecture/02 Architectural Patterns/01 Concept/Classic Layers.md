# Classic Layers

> <- Back to [[Layered Architecture]]

Presentation -> Business Logic -> Data Access -> Database. The traditional layered architecture where each layer depends only on the layer directly below it. Simple and widely understood, but can lead to tight coupling to the database layer.

## Key Properties

- [[Layer Responsibility]]
- [[Dependency Direction]]
- [[Layer Isolation]]

## Related

- [[Clean Architecture]] (inverts dependency direction)
- [[Separation of Concerns]] (each layer handles one concern)
