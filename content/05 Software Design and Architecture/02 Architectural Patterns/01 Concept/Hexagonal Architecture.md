# Hexagonal Architecture

> <- Back to [[Layered Architecture]]

Ports and Adapters. Core domain is isolated from infrastructure through ports (interfaces the domain exposes) and adapters (implementations that connect to external systems). The domain knows nothing about the outside world.

## Key Properties

- [[Ports and Adapters]]
- [[Domain Isolation]]
- [[Testable Core]]

## Related

- [[Clean Architecture]] (similar approach)
- [[Onion Architecture]] (concentric layers variant)
- [[Dependency Inversion Principle]] (foundational principle)
