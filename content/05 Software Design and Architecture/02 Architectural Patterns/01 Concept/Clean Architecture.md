# Clean Architecture

> <- Back to [[Layered Architecture]]

Entities -> Use Cases -> Interface Adapters -> Frameworks (Uncle Bob). Dependencies point inward toward the core domain. The domain layer has no knowledge of frameworks, databases, or UI. Enables testability and independence from external concerns.

## Key Properties

- [[Dependency Rule]]
- [[Use Case Driven]]
- [[Framework Independence]]

## Related

- [[Hexagonal Architecture]] (similar concept, different terminology)
- [[Dependency Inversion Principle]] (core mechanism)
