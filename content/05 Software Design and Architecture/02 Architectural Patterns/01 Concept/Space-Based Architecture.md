# Space-Based Architecture

> <- Back to [[Other Architectural Styles]]

In-memory data grids and processing units for extreme scale. Distributes processing and storage across multiple processing units that share data through replicated in-memory grids. Eliminates the database bottleneck for high-throughput, low-latency applications.
