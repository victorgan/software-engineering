Single responsibility per service, independent deployment, own data store. Each service is small enough for a small team to own, can be deployed independently, uses its own data storage, and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs.

## Key Properties

- [[Service Autonomy]]
- [[Independent Deployment]]
- [[Bounded Context Alignment]]

## Related
