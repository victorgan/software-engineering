# BigQuery (GCP)

> <- Back to [[GCP Databases]]

Serverless data warehouse. SQL interface, petabyte-scale, columnar storage, built-in ML (BQML), streaming inserts, BI Engine for fast dashboards. Pay per query (data scanned) or flat-rate. Also serves as the primary analytics engine. Equivalent to AWS Redshift but fully serverless. Evolved from Google's internal Dremel.
