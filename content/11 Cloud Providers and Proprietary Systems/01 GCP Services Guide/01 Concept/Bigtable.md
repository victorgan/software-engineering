# Bigtable

> <- Back to [[GCP Databases]]

Managed wide-column NoSQL database with HBase-compatible API. Low latency at massive scale (petabytes). Used internally by Google for Search, Maps, Gmail. Inspired HBase and influenced Cassandra. Equivalent to AWS Keyspaces/DynamoDB for wide-column workloads.
