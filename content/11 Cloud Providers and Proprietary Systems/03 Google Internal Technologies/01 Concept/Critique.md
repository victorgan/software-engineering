# Critique

> <- Back to [[Google Build and Development]]

Google's internal code review tool. Integrated with Piper (monorepo), Tricorder (static analysis), and TAP (testing). Industry equivalents: GitHub PRs, Gerrit (open source, also from Google). All code changes at Google go through Critique review.
