Critique is Google's internal code review tool, tightly integrated with Piper (monorepo), Tricorder (static analysis), and TAP (testing). Gerrit is an open-source code review tool also from Google (built for Android). GitHub Pull Requests serve the same purpose in the broader industry. All enforce the practice that every code change requires peer review.
