# TensorFlow Mapping

> <- Back to [[Developer Tools Mapping]]

| | Google Internal | Open Source | GCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| System | TensorFlow (internal) | TensorFlow | Vertex AI |
| Concept | ML framework | ML framework | Managed ML platform |

TensorFlow originated as an internal Google ML framework and was open-sourced in 2015. Unlike most Google internal-to-external mappings, TensorFlow is the same system both internally and externally. On GCP, Vertex AI provides the managed platform for training and deploying TensorFlow (and other framework) models.
