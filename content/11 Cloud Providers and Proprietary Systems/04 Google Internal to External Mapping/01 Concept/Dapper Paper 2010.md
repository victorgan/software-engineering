**"Dapper, a Large-Scale Distributed Systems Tracing Infrastructure" (2010)** -- Sigelman et al.

Described Google's approach to distributed tracing: propagating trace context (trace IDs and span IDs) through RPCs, sampling, and low-overhead instrumentation. Defined the concepts used by all modern tracing systems. Inspired Zipkin (Twitter), Jaeger (Uber), and eventually OpenTelemetry.
