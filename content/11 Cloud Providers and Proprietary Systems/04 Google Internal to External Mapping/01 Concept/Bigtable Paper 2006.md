**"Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data" (2006)** -- Chang et al.

Introduced the wide-column data model: rows, column families, and timestamps. Designed for petabyte-scale structured data with consistent low-latency access. Built on GFS and Chubby. Directly inspired HBase and partially inspired Cassandra's data model.
