# Noise

> <- Back to [[Channel Capacity]]

Random disturbances that corrupt transmitted data. Noise models include the binary symmetric channel (bits flip with probability p), the additive white Gaussian noise channel, and the erasure channel. Channel capacity quantifies the maximum reliable information rate achievable in the presence of noise.
