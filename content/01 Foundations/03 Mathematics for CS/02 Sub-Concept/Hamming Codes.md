# Hamming Codes

> <- Back to [[Error Correction]]

A family of linear error-correcting codes that can detect up to two-bit errors and correct single-bit errors. Uses parity bits placed at power-of-2 positions. Hamming distance (number of differing bits between codewords) determines the error-detection and correction capability.
