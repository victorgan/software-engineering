# Huffman Coding (IT)

> <- Back to [[Compression]]

An optimal prefix-free coding scheme that assigns shorter codewords to more frequent symbols. Achieves compression close to the entropy limit. Used in JPEG, MP3, and ZIP formats as a component. A greedy algorithm builds the code by repeatedly merging lowest-frequency symbols.
