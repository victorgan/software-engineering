# PageRank

> <- Back to [[Markov Chains]]

Google's original algorithm for ranking web pages. Models web browsing as a Markov chain where the steady-state probability of each page represents its importance. A random surfer follows links with probability d and jumps to a random page with probability 1-d. Computed iteratively via the power method on the transition matrix.
