# Inverse

> <- Back to [[Vectors and Matrices]]

A matrix A^(-1) such that A * A^(-1) = I (identity matrix). Only square matrices with non-zero determinant are invertible. Used for solving systems of linear equations (x = A^(-1)b). Computing the inverse has O(n^3) complexity. In practice, direct solution methods (LU decomposition) are preferred over explicit inversion.
