# Basis

> <- Back to [[Vector Spaces]]

A minimal set of vectors that spans the entire vector space. Every vector in the space can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors. The standard basis for R^n uses unit vectors along each axis. Choosing a good basis simplifies computation in many applications.
