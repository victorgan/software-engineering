> <- Back to [[Compression]]

Dictionary-based lossless compression algorithms by Lempel and Ziv. LZ77 uses a sliding window to reference earlier occurrences of data. LZ78 builds an explicit dictionary during compression. The basis for gzip, deflate, PNG, and GIF formats. Achieve universal compression without knowing the source statistics.
