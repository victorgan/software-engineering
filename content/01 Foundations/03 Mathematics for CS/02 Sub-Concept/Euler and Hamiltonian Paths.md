# Euler and Hamiltonian Paths

> <- Back to [[Graph Theory]]

An Euler path visits every edge exactly once; a Hamiltonian path visits every vertex exactly once. Euler path existence is easily checked (all vertices have even degree), while Hamiltonian path is NP-Complete. This contrast illustrates the gap between polynomial and exponential problems.
