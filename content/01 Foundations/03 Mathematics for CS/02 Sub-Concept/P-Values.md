# P-Values

> <- Back to [[Statistical Inference]]

The probability of observing data at least as extreme as the actual observations, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) is evidence against the null hypothesis. Widely used but often misinterpreted; a p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
