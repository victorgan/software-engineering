# Prior

> <- Back to [[Bayesian Statistics]]

The probability distribution representing belief about a parameter before observing data. Priors can be informative (based on domain knowledge) or uninformative (vague, letting data dominate). The choice of prior is the distinguishing feature of Bayesian analysis and can significantly influence results with small datasets.
