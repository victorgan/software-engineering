# Primes

> <- Back to [[Number Theory]]

Numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states every integer > 1 has a unique prime factorization. Primes are central to cryptography (RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large semiprimes). Primality testing and prime generation are key algorithmic tasks.
