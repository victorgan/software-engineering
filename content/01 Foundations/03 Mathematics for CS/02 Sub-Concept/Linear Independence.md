# Linear Independence

> <- Back to [[Vector Spaces]]

A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. Equivalently, the only solution to c1*v1 + c2*v2 + ... = 0 is all coefficients equal to zero. Linear independence is the requirement for a set of vectors to form a basis.
