# Poisson Distribution

> <- Back to [[Distributions]]

Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate. P(X = k) = (lambda^k * e^(-lambda)) / k!. Used in modeling server requests, network packet arrivals, and rare events. Approximates Binomial when n is large and p is small.
