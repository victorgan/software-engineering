# Binomial Coefficients

> <- Back to [[Combinatorics]]

The values C(n,k) that appear in the binomial theorem expansion of (a+b)^n. Arranged in Pascal's triangle where each entry is the sum of the two above. Used in probability, combinatorial identities, and polynomial expansion. Can be computed efficiently via dynamic programming.
