# Solving Recurrences

> <- Back to [[Recurrence Relations]]

Techniques for finding closed-form expressions from recursive definitions. Methods include substitution (guess and verify), recursion trees (visual analysis of recursive work), and the characteristic equation method (for linear recurrences). Essential for analyzing recursive algorithms.
