> <- Back to [[Information Theory]]

Techniques for detecting and correcting errors introduced during data transmission or storage. Error correction codes add redundancy to data, enabling reliable communication over noisy channels.

## Key Properties

- [[Hamming Codes]]
- [[Reed-Solomon]]
- [[Checksums]]

## Related
