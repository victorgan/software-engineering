# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

> <- Back to [[Linear Algebra]]

Scalar-vector pairs that characterize linear transformations. Eigenvectors are directions that remain unchanged by a transformation, and eigenvalues are the scaling factors. They are central to PCA, spectral methods, and stability analysis.
