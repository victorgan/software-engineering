# Channel Capacity

> <- Back to [[Information Theory]]

The maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. Shannon's theorem establishes that error-free communication is possible at rates below channel capacity.

## Key Properties

- [[Shannon's Theorem]]
- [[Noise]]
