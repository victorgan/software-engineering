# Compression

> <- Back to [[Information Theory]]

Techniques for reducing the size of data representations. Compression algorithms exploit redundancy and statistical properties of data to achieve smaller encodings, either losslessly or with controlled loss.

## Key Properties

- [[Huffman Coding (IT)]]
- [[Arithmetic Coding]]
- [[LZ77 and LZ78]]

## Related

- [[Entropy]] (theoretical limit of lossless compression)
