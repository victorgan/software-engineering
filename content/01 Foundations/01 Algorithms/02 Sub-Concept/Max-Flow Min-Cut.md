# Max-Flow Min-Cut

> <- Back to [[Network Flow]]

A theorem stating that the maximum flow through a network equals the minimum capacity of a cut separating source and sink. This duality connects flow algorithms with cut problems and has applications in network reliability, image segmentation, and bipartite matching.
