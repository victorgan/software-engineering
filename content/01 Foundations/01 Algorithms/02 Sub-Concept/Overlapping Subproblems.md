# Overlapping Subproblems

> <- Back to [[Core Concepts (DP)]]

A property where the same subproblems are solved multiple times during recursion. DP exploits this by storing previously computed results, avoiding redundant work. Classic example: Fibonacci numbers recompute the same values exponentially without memoization.
