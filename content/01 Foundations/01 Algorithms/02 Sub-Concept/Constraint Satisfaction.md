> <- Back to [[Backtracking]]

A framework for solving problems defined by variables, domains, and constraints. Backtracking systematically assigns values to variables and backtracks when constraints are violated. Enhanced by techniques like arc consistency, forward checking, and variable/value ordering heuristics.
