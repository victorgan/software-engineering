# In-Place vs Extra Space

> <- Back to [[Analysis]]

Whether a sorting algorithm requires only O(1) additional memory (in-place) or needs extra space proportional to the input. Quicksort and heapsort are in-place; merge sort requires O(n) extra space. This tradeoff affects practical performance on memory-constrained systems.
