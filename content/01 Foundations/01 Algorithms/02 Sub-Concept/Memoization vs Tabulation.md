# Memoization vs Tabulation

> <- Back to [[Core Concepts (DP)]]

Two implementation approaches for dynamic programming. Memoization (top-down) uses recursion with a cache, solving only needed subproblems. Tabulation (bottom-up) fills a table iteratively, solving all subproblems in order. Tabulation avoids recursion overhead; memoization can skip unnecessary subproblems.
