# Ford-Fulkerson

> <- Back to [[Network Flow]]

A method for computing maximum flow in a flow network by repeatedly finding augmenting paths from source to sink and increasing flow along them. The runtime depends on the method used to find augmenting paths. May not terminate with irrational capacities.
