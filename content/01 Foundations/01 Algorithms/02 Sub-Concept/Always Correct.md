# Always Correct

> <- Back to [[Las Vegas]]

Las Vegas algorithms always produce the correct result, unlike Monte Carlo algorithms which may err. The randomness affects only the runtime, not the correctness. This provides the same guarantees as deterministic algorithms while often achieving better expected performance.
