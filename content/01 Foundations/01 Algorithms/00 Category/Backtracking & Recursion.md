# Backtracking & Recursion

**Back:** [[Algorithms]]

Techniques that explore solution spaces through recursive decomposition. Backtracking systematically tries and eliminates candidates, divide and conquer breaks problems into independent subproblems, and recursion patterns describe common structures for self-referential computation.
