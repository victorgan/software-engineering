# Recursion Patterns

> <- Back to [[Backtracking & Recursion]]

Common structural patterns found in recursive algorithms. Understanding these patterns helps identify when recursion is appropriate and how to optimize it.

## Key Properties

- [[Tail Recursion]]
- [[Mutual Recursion]]
- [[Recursive Descent Parsing]]

## Related

- [[Backtracking]] (uses recursion)
- [[Divide and Conquer]] (uses recursion)
