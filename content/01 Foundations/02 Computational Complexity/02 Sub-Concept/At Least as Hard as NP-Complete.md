# At Least as Hard as NP-Complete

> <- Back to [[NP-Hard]]

NP-Hard problems are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. Every NP problem can be reduced to an NP-Hard problem in polynomial time. Unlike NP-Complete, NP-Hard problems are not required to be in NP themselves, meaning they may not even have efficiently verifiable solutions.
