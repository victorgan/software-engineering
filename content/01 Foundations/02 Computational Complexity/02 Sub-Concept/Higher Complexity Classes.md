# Higher Complexity Classes

> <- Back to [[PSPACE, EXPTIME]]

Complexity classes beyond NP that capture harder problems. PSPACE contains problems solvable with polynomial space (includes all of NP). EXPTIME contains problems solvable in exponential time. Examples: PSPACE-complete problems include QBF (quantified Boolean formulas) and certain game-playing problems.
