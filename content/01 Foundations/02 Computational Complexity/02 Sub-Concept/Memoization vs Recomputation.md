# Memoization vs Recomputation

> <- Back to [[Space-Time Tradeoffs]]

The tradeoff between storing computed results (memoization) and recomputing them when needed. Memoization uses more memory but avoids redundant computation. Recomputation uses less memory but may be slower. The choice depends on available memory and the cost of recomputation.
