# Time Complexity

**Back:** [[Computational Complexity]]

The amount of time an algorithm takes as a function of its input size. Time complexity provides a framework for comparing algorithms and predicting performance at scale using asymptotic notation.

## Concepts

- [[Big-O Notation]]
- [[Big-Omega Notation]]
- [[Big-Theta Notation]]
- [[Amortized Analysis]]
- [[Common Classes]]
