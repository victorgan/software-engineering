# Complexity Classes

**Back:** [[Computational Complexity]]

Groupings of computational problems based on the resources required to solve them. Complexity classes define the landscape of computational tractability and establish which problems can be efficiently solved by different models of computation.

## Concepts

- [[P]]
- [[NP]]
- [[NP-Complete]]
- [[NP-Hard]]
- [[P vs NP Problem]]
- [[PSPACE, EXPTIME]]
- [[Undecidable Problems]]
