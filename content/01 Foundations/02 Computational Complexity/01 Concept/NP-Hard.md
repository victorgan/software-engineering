# NP-Hard

> <- Back to [[Complexity Classes]]

Problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. NP-Hard problems may not themselves be in NP (they may not even be decision problems or verifiable in polynomial time).

## Key Properties

- [[At Least as Hard as NP-Complete]]

## Related

- [[NP-Complete]] (NP-Complete = NP-Hard and in NP)
- [[NP]] (NP-Hard may not be in NP)
