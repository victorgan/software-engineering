# Amortized Analysis

> <- Back to [[Time Complexity]]

A method that averages the time required for a sequence of operations over the entire sequence, even though individual operations may be expensive. Classic example: dynamic array resizing has O(1) amortized insert despite occasional O(n) resizes.
