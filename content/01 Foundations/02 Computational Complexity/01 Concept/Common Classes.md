# Common Classes

> <- Back to [[Time Complexity]]

The most frequently encountered time complexity classes, forming a hierarchy from constant time to factorial time. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for evaluating algorithm efficiency.

## Key Properties

- [[O(1) Constant]]
- [[O(log n) Logarithmic]]
- [[O(n) Linear]]
- [[O(n log n) Linearithmic]]
- [[O(n squared) Quadratic]]
- [[O(2 to the n) Exponential]]
- [[O(n!) Factorial]]
