> <- Back to [[Complexity Classes]]

The most important open question in computer science: does every problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time also have a polynomial-time solution? One of the seven Millennium Prize Problems with a $1 million bounty.

## Key Properties

- [[The Million-Dollar Open Question]]

## Related

- [[P]] (one side of the question)
- [[NP]] (the other side)
- [[NP-Complete]] (if any NPC problem is in P, then P = NP)
