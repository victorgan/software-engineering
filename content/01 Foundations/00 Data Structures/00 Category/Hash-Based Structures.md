# Hash-Based Structures

**Back:** [[Data Structures]]

Use hash functions to map keys to positions for fast lookups. Average O(1) access at the cost of extra memory and hash collision handling. Hash-based structures are indispensable for building caches, indexes, and deduplication systems.

## Concepts

- [[Hash Tables]]
- [[Hash Sets]]
- [[Bloom Filters]]
- [[Consistent Hashing]]
