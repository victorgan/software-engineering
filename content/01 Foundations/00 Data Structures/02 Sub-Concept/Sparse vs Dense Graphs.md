# Sparse vs Dense Graphs

> ← Back to [[Special Graphs]]

Sparse: E ≈ O(V), few edges relative to vertices (most real-world graphs: social networks, road maps). Dense: E ≈ O(V²), many edges. The distinction drives representation choice: [[Adjacency List]] for sparse, [[Adjacency Matrix]] for dense.
