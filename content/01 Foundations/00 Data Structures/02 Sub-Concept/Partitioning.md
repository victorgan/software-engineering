# Partitioning

> ← Back to [[Consistent Hashing]]

Distributing data across multiple nodes. Consistent hashing minimizes the amount of data that needs to move when nodes are added or removed — only K/n keys migrate on average. Used in DynamoDB, Cassandra, and CDN routing. See [[Sharding and Partitioning]].
