# Binary Search Trees

> ← Back to [[Tree Structures]]

Binary tree where left subtree contains values less than the node and right subtree contains values greater. Enables efficient searching, but degrades to O(n) if unbalanced.

## Key Properties

- [[BST Search]]
- [[BST Insert]]
- [[BST Delete]]

## Complexity

| Operation | Average    | Worst (unbalanced) |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Search    | O(log n)   | O(n)                |
| Insert    | O(log n)   | O(n)                |
| Delete    | O(log n)   | O(n)                |
