# Arrays

> ← Back to [[Linear Structures]]

Contiguous block of memory storing elements of the same type. The most fundamental data structure — basis for many others.

## Key Properties

- [[Contiguous Memory]]
- [[O(1) Random Access]]
- [[Fixed vs Dynamic Sizing]]

## Complexity

| Operation            | Time Complexity       |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Access               | O(1)                  |
| Search               | O(n)                  |
| Insert at end        | O(1) amortized (dynamic) |
| Insert at position   | O(n)                  |
| Delete               | O(n)                  |
