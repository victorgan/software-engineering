# Graph Representations

> ← Back to [[Graph Structures]]

The three main ways to represent a graph in memory, each with different space and time tradeoffs for common operations.

## Key Properties

- [[Adjacency List]]
- [[Adjacency Matrix]]
- [[Edge List]]

## Tradeoffs

- **Adjacency list** — O(V+E) space, efficient for sparse graphs.
- **Adjacency matrix** — O(V²) space, O(1) edge lookup, better for dense graphs.
- **Edge list** — simplest, O(E) space, slow lookups.
