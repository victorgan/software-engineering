# Disjoint Set Union-Find

> ← Back to [[Advanced Structures]]

Tracks a collection of non-overlapping sets. Supports two operations efficiently: find (which set is this element in?) and union (merge two sets).

## Key Properties

- [[Connected Components]]
- [[Kruskals Algorithm]]

## Complexity

Nearly O(1) amortized per operation with path compression and union by rank — technically O(a(n)) where a is the inverse Ackermann function.
