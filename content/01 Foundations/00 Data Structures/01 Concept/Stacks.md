# Stacks

> ← Back to [[Linear Structures]]

Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) collection. Elements are pushed onto and popped from the top. Can be implemented with arrays or linked lists.

## Key Properties

- [[LIFO]]
- [[Call Stack]]
- [[Expression Evaluation]]
- [[Undo Mechanisms]]

## Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Push      | O(1)            |
| Pop       | O(1)            |
| Peek      | O(1)            |
