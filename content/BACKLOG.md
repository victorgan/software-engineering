- Change the prefixing numbers of 00 Category, 01 Concept, 02 Sub-Concept to 0, 1
and 2 for clarity
- In the MOC, remove the prefixing number, which is redundant.
- remove tags in favor of note tags. Put the note tags in the yaml metadata
headers instead of at the bottom of the file.
- Increase linking throughout; eg in the "Choosing a Shard Key" note, link
hotspots when it's mentioned

Integrate knowledge from the following online sources:

  Comprehensive SE Knowledge Bases

  - https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering -- The most
  authoritative reference. IEEE's "Software Engineering Body of Knowledge" covers 18
  knowledge areas. Your vault's scope is actually broader (it includes ML, career
  development, cloud providers, etc.).
  https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/media/education/swebok/swebok-v4.pdf
  - https://publish.obsidian.md/kaas-published/0-Slipbox/Software+Engineering+Career+Notes
  -- A published Obsidian vault with structured SE notes. Probably the closest in format,
  though much smaller in scope.

  Popular GitHub Repos

  - https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer (233k stars) -- Covers system design
   at scale with diagrams and flashcards. Deep on distributed systems but narrow in scope
  compared to yours.
  - https://github.com/liuchong/awesome-roadmaps (255k+ stars) -- Visual roadmaps for
  different engineering paths. Breadth without depth.
  - https://github.com/smenjas/software-engineering-notes -- Structured SE notes on GitHub,
  but much more limited.

  Curricula & Courses

  - https://www.scaler.com/blog/software-engineering-syllabus/ -- A structured curriculum
  covering DSA, OS, DBMS, system design, cloud/DevOps. Similar topic coverage but in course
  format, not interlinked notes.

  Obsidian Community Approaches

  - https://forum.obsidian.md/t/pkm-for-programmers-software-engineers-etc/56002 and
  https://forum.obsidian.md/t/software-developer-knowledge-base/39259 -- Discussions about
  building SE knowledge bases in Obsidian, but no one seems to have published a vault as
  comprehensive as yours (~2,950 interlinked notes covering foundations through career
  development).
