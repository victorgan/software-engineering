# Time-Series Database Tradeoffs

> <- Back to [[Time-Series Databases]]

Fast ingestion and time-range queries, but limited general-purpose query capabilities. TimescaleDB wins when you need Postgres compatibility. ClickHouse wins for analytical queries. Prometheus is purpose-built for monitoring, not general time-series storage.

## Key Properties

- [[Fast Ingestion and Time-Range Queries]]
- [[Limited General-Purpose Queries]]
- [[TimescaleDB for Postgres Compatibility]]
- [[ClickHouse for Analytics]]
