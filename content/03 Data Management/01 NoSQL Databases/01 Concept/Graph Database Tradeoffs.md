# Graph Database Tradeoffs

> <- Back to [[Graph Databases]]

Excels at traversing deep relationships where relational joins would be expensive. Poor for bulk analytics, aggregations, or simple CRUD. Smaller ecosystem and tooling. Consider whether Postgres recursive CTEs or a relational model suffice before reaching for a graph DB.

## Key Properties

- [[Deep Relationship Traversal]]
- [[Poor for Bulk Analytics]]
- [[Smaller Ecosystem]]
- [[Consider Relational Alternatives First]]
