# Cost

> <- Back to [[Key Decision Factors]]

Open source is free but self-hosting has infrastructure costs. Managed services charge for convenience. Commercial licenses (Oracle, SQL Server) are significant at scale. Serverless (DynamoDB, Firestore) uses pay-per-request pricing that can be expensive at high throughput.
