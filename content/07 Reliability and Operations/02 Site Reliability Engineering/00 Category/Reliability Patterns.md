# Reliability Patterns

**Back:** [[Site Reliability Engineering]]

Design patterns and engineering practices that make systems more resilient to failure. From circuit breakers and bulkheads to health checks and redundancy, these patterns are the building blocks of reliable distributed systems.

## Concepts

- [[Graceful Degradation]]
- [[Circuit Breakers]]
- [[Bulkheads]]
- [[Timeouts]]
- [[Retries with Backoff]]
- [[Rate Limiting]]
- [[Health Checks]]
- [[Redundancy]]
