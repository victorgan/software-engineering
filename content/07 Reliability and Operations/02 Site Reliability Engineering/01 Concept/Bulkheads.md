Isolation pattern that prevents failure in one component from cascading to others. Named after ship compartments, bulkheads in software include separate thread pools, connection pools, or process isolation per dependency, limiting the blast radius of failures.

## Key Properties

- [[Resource Isolation]]
- [[Failure Containment]]
