# Choosing SLOs

> <- Back to [[SLAs, SLOs, SLIs]]

SLOs should be based on user expectations and business requirements, not on what the system currently achieves. Start with user-facing metrics, consult stakeholders, set achievable but meaningful targets, and iterate as you learn. Overly aggressive SLOs waste engineering effort; overly lax SLOs permit poor user experience.
