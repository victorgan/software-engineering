**Back:** [[07 - Reliability and Operations MOC]]

Performance engineering is the discipline of ensuring systems meet their performance requirements through profiling, benchmarking, load testing, capacity planning, and chaos engineering. It spans from micro-level code optimization to macro-level system architecture decisions that determine how a system behaves under load.
