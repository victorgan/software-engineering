# Compression (Performance)

> <- Back to [[Performance Optimization Patterns]]

Reducing data size for network transfer using algorithms like gzip, Brotli, and zstd. Compression trades CPU time for bandwidth reduction, which is almost always a favorable tradeoff for network-bound operations. Brotli provides better compression ratios; zstd offers the best speed-to-ratio balance.
