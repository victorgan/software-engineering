# Macro-Benchmarks

> <- Back to [[Benchmarking]]

System-level performance tests that measure end-to-end behavior under realistic conditions. Unlike micro-benchmarks, macro-benchmarks capture the full stack including network, serialization, database access, and inter-service communication.

## Key Properties

- [[End-to-End Measurement]]
- [[Realistic Workloads]]
- [[System-Level Bottleneck Detection]]
