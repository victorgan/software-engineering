# Chaos Engineering Principles

> <- Back to [[Chaos Engineering]]

The scientific methodology of chaos engineering: define steady state behavior, hypothesize that steady state will continue during failure, introduce real-world failures, and observe whether the hypothesis holds. Run experiments in production to get real results.

## Key Properties

- [[Steady State Definition]]
- [[Hypothesis Formation]]
- [[Controlled Experimentation]]
