# Steady State Definition

> <- Back to [[Chaos Engineering Principles]]

Defining the normal, healthy behavior of a system in measurable terms before introducing chaos. Steady state is typically defined by key business metrics (orders per minute, login success rate) and system metrics (latency, error rate). Without a clear steady state, you cannot detect the impact of failures.
