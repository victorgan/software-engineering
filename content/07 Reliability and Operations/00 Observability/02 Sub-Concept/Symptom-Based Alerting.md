# Symptom-Based Alerting

> <- Back to [[Alerting Philosophy]]

Alerting on user-visible symptoms (high error rate, increased latency) rather than internal causes (CPU spike, disk usage). Symptom-based alerts are more reliable because a single symptom may have many causes, and not all causes produce user-visible symptoms.
