# DR Tier - Pilot Light

> <- Back to [[Disaster Recovery Tiers]]

Minimal always-on infrastructure in the DR region (e.g., replicated database, core networking) that can be scaled up quickly on failure. Like a gas pilot light, the core is always running but resources are provisioned on-demand during recovery.

## Key Properties

- [[Minimal Always-On Resources]]
- [[Scale-Up on Failure]]
- [[Moderate Recovery Time]]
