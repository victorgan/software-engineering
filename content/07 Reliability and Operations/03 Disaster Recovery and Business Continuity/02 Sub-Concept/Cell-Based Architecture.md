# Cell-Based Architecture

> <- Back to [[Blast Radius Reduction]]

An architectural pattern where the system is divided into independent cells, each serving a subset of users or tenants. A failure in one cell does not affect others. Used by AWS, Azure, and large-scale SaaS providers to limit blast radius.
