# Token Bucket Algorithm

> <- Back to [[Throttling]]

A rate limiting algorithm where tokens are added to a bucket at a fixed rate, and each request consumes a token. Requests are rejected when the bucket is empty. The bucket capacity allows for short bursts while maintaining a sustained rate limit.
