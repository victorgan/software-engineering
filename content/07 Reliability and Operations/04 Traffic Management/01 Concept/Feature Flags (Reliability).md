# Feature Flags (Reliability)

> <- Back to [[Configuration Management in Production]]

Runtime configuration switches that enable or disable features without deploying new code. Feature flags enable safe rollouts, A/B testing, and instant rollback. See also [[CI-CD]]. Flags should be short-lived and cleaned up after full rollout.

## Key Properties
