# Massively Parallel Workloads

> <- Back to [[GPU Computing]]

Workloads that can be decomposed into thousands or millions of independent operations, such as matrix multiplication, image processing, neural network training, and physics simulation. GPUs excel at these because their architecture is optimized for throughput over latency.
