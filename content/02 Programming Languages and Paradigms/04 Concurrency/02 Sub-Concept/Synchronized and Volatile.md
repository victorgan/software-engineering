# Synchronized and Volatile

> <- Back to [[Java Concurrency]]

Java's built-in synchronization primitives. `synchronized` provides mutual exclusion and memory visibility (monitor pattern). `volatile` ensures that reads and writes to a variable are always visible to all threads (prevents caching in registers) but does not provide atomicity for compound operations.
