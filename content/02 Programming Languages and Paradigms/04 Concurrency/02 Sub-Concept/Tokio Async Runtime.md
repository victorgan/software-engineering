# Tokio Async Runtime

> <- Back to [[Rust Concurrency]]

The most popular async runtime for Rust, providing an event loop, async I/O, timers, and a work-stealing task scheduler. Rust's async/await syntax compiles to state machines, and tokio provides the executor that drives these state machines to completion.
