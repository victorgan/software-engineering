# Recursive Task Decomposition

> <- Back to [[Fork-Join]]

A problem is recursively divided into smaller subproblems (fork) until they are small enough to solve directly. Solutions are then combined bottom-up (join). This divide-and-conquer approach naturally maps to parallel execution on multi-core systems.
