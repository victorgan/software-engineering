# Isolated Actors with Asynchronous Messages

> <- Back to [[Actor Model]]

Each actor is an isolated unit with its own private state and a mailbox for incoming messages. Actors process messages one at a time (sequential within an actor), send messages to other actors, and create new actors. Communication is asynchronous and non-blocking.
