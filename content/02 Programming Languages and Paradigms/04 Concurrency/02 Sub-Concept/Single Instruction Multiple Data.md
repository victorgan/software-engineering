# Single Instruction Multiple Data

> <- Back to [[SIMD]]

A single CPU instruction operates on a vector of data elements simultaneously. For example, one SIMD instruction can add 4 or 8 floating-point numbers in parallel. Modern CPUs provide SIMD instruction sets like SSE, AVX (x86), and NEON (ARM).
