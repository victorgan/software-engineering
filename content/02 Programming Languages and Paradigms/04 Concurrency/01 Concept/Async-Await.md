# Async-Await

> <- Back to [[Concurrency Models]]

Cooperative multitasking using an event loop where async functions can suspend execution at await points, yielding control back to the runtime. This enables non-blocking I/O with sequential-looking code, avoiding callback hell while efficiently managing many concurrent I/O operations.
