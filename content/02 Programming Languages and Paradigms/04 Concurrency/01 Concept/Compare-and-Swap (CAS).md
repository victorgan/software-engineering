# Compare-and-Swap (CAS)

> <- Back to [[Lock-Free & Wait-Free Programming]]

An atomic hardware instruction that compares a memory location with an expected value and, only if they match, atomically replaces it with a new value. CAS is the fundamental building block of all lock-free data structures and algorithms.
