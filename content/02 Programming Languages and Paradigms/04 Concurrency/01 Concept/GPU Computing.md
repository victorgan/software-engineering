# GPU Computing

> <- Back to [[Data Parallelism]]

Using graphics processing units for general-purpose computation. GPUs have thousands of cores optimized for data-parallel workloads, providing massive throughput for matrix operations, neural network training, simulation, and other embarrassingly parallel tasks.

## Key Properties

- [[CUDA and OpenCL]]
- [[Massively Parallel Workloads]]
