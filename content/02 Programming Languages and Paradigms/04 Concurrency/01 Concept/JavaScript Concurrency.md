# JavaScript Concurrency

> <- Back to [[Language-Specific Concurrency]]

JavaScript uses a single-threaded event loop that processes callbacks from an event queue. Async/await provides syntactic sugar over promises for non-blocking I/O. Web Workers enable true parallelism by running JavaScript in separate threads with message passing.

## Key Properties

- [[Single-threaded Event Loop]]
- [[Web Workers for Parallelism]]
