# Lock-Free Data Structures

> <- Back to [[Lock-Free & Wait-Free Programming]]

Data structures that use atomic operations (particularly CAS) instead of locks to manage concurrent access. Lock-free structures guarantee system-wide progress: at least one thread makes progress in any given time period, even if others are delayed.

## Key Properties

- [[Lock-Free Queues]]
- [[Lock-Free Stacks]]
- [[Lock-Free Hash Maps]]
