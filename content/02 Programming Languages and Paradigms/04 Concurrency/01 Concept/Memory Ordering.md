# Memory Ordering

> <- Back to [[Lock-Free & Wait-Free Programming]]

Rules governing the visible order of memory operations across threads. Different ordering levels trade off between correctness guarantees and performance, from strict sequential consistency to relaxed ordering that allows maximum hardware optimization.

## Key Properties

- [[Sequential Consistency]]
- [[Acquire-Release]]
- [[Relaxed Ordering]]
