# Concurrency Hazards & Patterns

**Back:** [[Concurrency]]

Common pitfalls and proven solutions in concurrent programming. Hazards like data races and false sharing can cause subtle, hard-to-reproduce bugs, while patterns like thread pools and producer-consumer provide well-tested structures for safe concurrent execution.

## Concepts

- [[Data Races]]
- [[Thread Starvation]]
- [[False Sharing]]
- [[Double-Checked Locking]]
- [[Thread Pools]]
- [[Producer-Consumer]]
- [[Readers-Writer Pattern]]
- [[Thread-Local Storage]]
