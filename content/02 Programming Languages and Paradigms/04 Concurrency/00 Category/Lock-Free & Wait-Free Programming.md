# Lock-Free & Wait-Free Programming

**Back:** [[Concurrency]]

Approaches to concurrent programming that avoid traditional locks, using atomic operations instead. Lock-free algorithms guarantee system-wide progress, while wait-free algorithms guarantee per-thread progress in bounded steps. These techniques eliminate deadlocks at the cost of increased implementation complexity.
