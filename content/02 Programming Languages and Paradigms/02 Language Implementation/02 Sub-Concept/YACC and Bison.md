# YACC and Bison

> <- Back to [[Parser Generators]]

Classic parser generators that produce LALR(1) parsers from grammar specifications. YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) is the original, and Bison is the GNU replacement. They generate C code from grammar files, widely used in Unix tooling and language implementations.
