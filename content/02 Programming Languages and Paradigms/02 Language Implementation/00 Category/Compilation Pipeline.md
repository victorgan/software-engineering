# Compilation Pipeline

**Back:** [[Language Implementation]]

The sequence of transformations that convert source code into executable form. Each stage refines the representation from human-readable text to machine-executable instructions, with opportunities for analysis and optimization along the way.

## Concepts

- [[Lexing - Tokenization]]
- [[Parsing (Compilation)]]
- [[Semantic Analysis]]
- [[Intermediate Representation (IR)]]
- [[Optimization]]
- [[Code Generation (Compilation)]]
