# Programming Paradigms

**Back:** [[02 - Programming Languages and Paradigms MOC]]

Programming paradigms are fundamental approaches to organizing and structuring code. Each paradigm provides a different way of thinking about computation, influencing how developers model problems, manage state, and compose solutions. The choice of paradigm shapes not just the code you write, but how you reason about software.
