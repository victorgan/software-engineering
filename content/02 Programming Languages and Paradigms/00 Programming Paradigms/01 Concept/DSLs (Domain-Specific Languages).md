# DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages)

> <- Back to [[Metaprogramming]]

Languages tailored to a specific problem domain, providing expressive syntax and abstractions that closely match the domain's concepts. Internal DSLs are embedded within a host language, while external DSLs have their own parser and syntax.

## Key Properties
