# Fluent Interfaces

> <- Back to [[DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages)]]

A design pattern for creating internal DSLs where method calls are chained to read like natural language. Each method returns the object itself (or a builder), enabling expressive, readable API usage like `query.where("age > 18").orderBy("name").limit(10)`.
