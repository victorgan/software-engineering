# Memory Models

**Back:** [[02 - Programming Languages and Paradigms MOC]]

Understanding stack versus heap allocation, garbage collection strategies, manual memory management, and ownership systems is essential for writing correct, efficient, and safe software. Memory layout decisions also directly impact cache performance and system throughput.
