# Big-endian vs Little-endian

> <- Back to [[Endianness]]

Big-endian (network byte order) stores the most significant byte at the lowest address. Little-endian (x86, ARM default) stores the least significant byte first. Conversion is required when exchanging data between systems with different endianness.
