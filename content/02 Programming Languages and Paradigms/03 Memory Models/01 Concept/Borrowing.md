# Borrowing

> <- Back to [[Ownership & Borrowing (Rust Model)]]

Creating references to data without taking ownership. Rust enforces that you can have either one mutable reference (&mut T) or any number of immutable references (&T) at a time, preventing data races and aliasing bugs at compile time.

## Key Properties

- [[Immutable References]]
- [[Mutable References]]
