# Variance

> <- Back to [[Generics - Parametric Polymorphism]]

Rules governing subtyping relationships between parameterized types. Covariance (`List<Dog>` is a subtype of `List<Animal>`) preserves the subtype relationship, contravariance reverses it, and invariance allows neither. Variance annotations ensure type safety when using generics with inheritance.
