# Types That Take Type Constructors as Parameters

> <- Back to [[Higher-Kinded Types]]

Higher-kinded types abstract over type constructors rather than concrete types. For example, a Functor type class works with any `F[_]` (List, Option, Future), enabling generic abstractions over containers. Supported in Haskell and Scala; approximated in Rust and TypeScript.
