# Advanced Type Features

**Back:** [[Type Systems]]

Sophisticated type system capabilities that enable more expressive and safer code. These features allow programmers to encode complex invariants, achieve polymorphism, and leverage the type system for correctness guarantees beyond basic type checking.

## Concepts

- [[Generics - Parametric Polymorphism]]
- [[Algebraic Data Types (Type Systems)]]
- [[Dependent Types]]
- [[Phantom Types]]
- [[Type Classes - Traits]]
- [[Higher-Kinded Types]]
- [[Refinement Types]]
- [[Structural vs Nominal Typing]]
