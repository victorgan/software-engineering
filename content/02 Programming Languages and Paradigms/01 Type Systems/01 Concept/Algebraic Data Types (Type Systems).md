# Algebraic Data Types (Type Systems)

> <- Back to [[Advanced Type Features]]

Types built from sum types (tagged unions) and product types (structs/tuples). ADTs precisely model domain concepts by enumerating all possible shapes of data, enabling exhaustive pattern matching and eliminating invalid states by construction.

## Key Properties

- [[Sum Types (Tagged Unions)]]
- [[Product Types (Structs-Tuples)]]
