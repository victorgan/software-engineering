# Higher-Kinded Types

> <- Back to [[Advanced Type Features]]

Types that take type constructors (rather than concrete types) as parameters. Higher-kinded types enable abstracting over type constructors like List, Option, or Future, allowing generic programming over container-like structures (e.g., defining Functor or Monad generically).
