# Scheduled Triggers

> <- Back to [[Event-Driven Serverless]]

Functions invoked on a schedule using cron expressions (e.g., every 5 minutes, daily at midnight). Used for batch processing, report generation, cleanup tasks, and health checks. AWS EventBridge Scheduler and Google Cloud Scheduler provide cron-like scheduling for serverless functions.
