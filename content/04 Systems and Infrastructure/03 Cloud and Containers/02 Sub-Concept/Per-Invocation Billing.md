# Per-Invocation Billing

> <- Back to [[Functions as a Service]]

FaaS charges per request and per GB-second of compute time. No charge when idle (scale to zero). Cost-effective for sporadic or unpredictable workloads. Can become expensive for high-throughput, steady-state workloads where reserved compute (containers, VMs) is more economical.
