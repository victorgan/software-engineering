# PersistentVolumes and Claims

> <- Back to [[K8s Storage]]

PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage provisioned by an admin or dynamically. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a pod. The PVC binds to a PV that satisfies its requirements (size, access mode, storage class). This abstraction separates storage provisioning from consumption.
