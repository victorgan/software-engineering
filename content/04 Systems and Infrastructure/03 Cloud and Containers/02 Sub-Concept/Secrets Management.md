# Secrets Management

> <- Back to [[Container Security]]

Securely handling sensitive data (passwords, API keys, certificates) in containerized environments. Never embed secrets in images or environment variables in Dockerfiles. Use Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or mounted secret files. Rotate secrets regularly and audit access.
