# Operator Lifecycle

> <- Back to [[Operators]]

Operators encode operational knowledge into software: installation, configuration, scaling, backup, upgrade, and failure recovery. The Operator Maturity Model ranges from Level 1 (basic install) to Level 5 (auto-pilot with full lifecycle management). Operators eliminate the need for manual runbooks.
