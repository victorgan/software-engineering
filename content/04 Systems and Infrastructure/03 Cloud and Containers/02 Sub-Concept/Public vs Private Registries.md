# Public vs Private Registries

> <- Back to [[Container Registries]]

Public registries (Docker Hub) host open-source images accessible to anyone. Private registries (ECR, GCR, self-hosted Harbor) restrict access to authorized users and are used for proprietary images. Best practice: use private registries for production images and mirror public images to avoid supply chain attacks.
