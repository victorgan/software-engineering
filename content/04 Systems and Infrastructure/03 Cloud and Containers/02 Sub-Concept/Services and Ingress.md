# Services and Ingress

> <- Back to [[Kubernetes]]

Services provide a stable IP and DNS name for a set of pods, with automatic load balancing. Pods are selected by labels. Ingress resources configure external HTTP/HTTPS access, including host-based and path-based routing, TLS termination, and integration with cloud load balancers.
