# Docker Volumes

> <- Back to [[Container Storage]]

Docker-managed storage that persists beyond the container lifecycle. Stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes/ on the host. Volumes can be shared between containers, backed up, and managed via Docker CLI. Named volumes are the recommended way to persist data in Docker.
