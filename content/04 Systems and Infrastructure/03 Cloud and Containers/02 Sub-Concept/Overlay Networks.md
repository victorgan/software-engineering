# Overlay Networks

> <- Back to [[Container Networking]]

Virtual networks that span multiple Docker hosts, enabling containers on different machines to communicate as if on the same network. Used in Docker Swarm and as the basis for Kubernetes networking plugins (Flannel, Calico, Weave). Uses encapsulation (VXLAN) to tunnel traffic between hosts.
