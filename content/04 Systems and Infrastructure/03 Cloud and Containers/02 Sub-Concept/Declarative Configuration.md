# Declarative Configuration

> <- Back to [[Terraform]]

Terraform configurations describe the desired end state, not the steps to reach it. The tool figures out what changes are needed (create, update, delete) to reach that state. This is safer than imperative approaches because the tool handles ordering, dependencies, and idempotency.
