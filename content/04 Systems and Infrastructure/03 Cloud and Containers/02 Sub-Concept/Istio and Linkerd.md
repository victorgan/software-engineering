# Istio and Linkerd

> <- Back to [[Service Mesh on K8s]]

The two leading Kubernetes service meshes. Istio (Google/IBM) is feature-rich but complex, using Envoy proxies and providing extensive traffic management, security, and observability. Linkerd (CNCF) is lighter-weight and simpler, using its own Rust-based proxy (linkerd2-proxy). Both provide mTLS, retries, and observability.
