> <- Back to [[Container Security]]

Automated analysis of container images for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in OS packages and application dependencies. Tools include Trivy, Snyk, Grype, and cloud-native scanners (ECR scanning, GCR vulnerability scanning). Should be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to prevent deploying vulnerable images.
