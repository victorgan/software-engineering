# CloudFormation Stacks

> <- Back to [[AWS CloudFormation]]

A collection of AWS resources managed as a single unit. Creating a stack provisions all defined resources; deleting it removes them all. Stacks can be nested (parent-child) for modularity. Stack events provide a log of all resource creation, update, and deletion operations.
