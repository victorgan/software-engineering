# Programming Abstractions

> <- Back to [[Pulumi]]

Pulumi components (classes) encapsulate groups of resources into reusable abstractions. Unlike Terraform modules (limited to HCL), Pulumi components use full object-oriented design: inheritance, composition, interfaces. This enables building higher-level infrastructure libraries tailored to organizational patterns.
