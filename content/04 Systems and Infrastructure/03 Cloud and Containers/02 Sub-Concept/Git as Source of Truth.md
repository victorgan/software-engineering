# Git as Source of Truth

> <- Back to [[GitOps]]

All infrastructure and application configuration lives in Git. Changes go through pull requests with code review. Git history provides a complete audit trail of who changed what and when. Rollback is as simple as reverting a Git commit. No direct kubectl apply or manual cluster changes.
