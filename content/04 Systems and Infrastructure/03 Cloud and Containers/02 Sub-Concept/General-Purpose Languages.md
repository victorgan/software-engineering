# General-Purpose Languages

> <- Back to [[Pulumi]]

Pulumi uses TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, or Java for infrastructure code. This means developers use familiar languages, existing tooling (IDEs, linters, debuggers, test frameworks), and programming constructs (loops, functions, classes, packages). Reduces the learning curve for developers already proficient in these languages.
