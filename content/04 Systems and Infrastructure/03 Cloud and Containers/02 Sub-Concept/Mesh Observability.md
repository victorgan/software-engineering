# Mesh Observability

> <- Back to [[Service Mesh on K8s]]

Service meshes automatically collect metrics (request rate, error rate, latency — the RED method), distributed traces, and access logs for all service-to-service communication. This provides deep visibility without instrumenting application code. Integrates with Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Kiali.
