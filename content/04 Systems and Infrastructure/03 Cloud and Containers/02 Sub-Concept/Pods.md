# Pods

> <- Back to [[Kubernetes]]

The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes — one or more containers that share the same network namespace (same IP, shared ports), storage volumes, and lifecycle. Containers in a pod communicate via localhost. Most pods have a single application container, but sidecar containers are common for logging, proxying, and monitoring.
