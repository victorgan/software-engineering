# Bind Mounts

> <- Back to [[Container Storage]]

Mapping a specific host directory or file into the container. The container sees the host filesystem directly. Useful for development (mount source code for live reloading) but creates a dependency on the host filesystem layout. Less portable than Docker volumes.
