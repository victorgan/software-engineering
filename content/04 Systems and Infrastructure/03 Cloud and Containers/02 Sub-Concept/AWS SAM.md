# AWS SAM

> <- Back to [[Serverless Frameworks]]

Serverless Application Model — an AWS-native framework that extends CloudFormation with serverless-specific resource types (AWS::Serverless::Function, AWS::Serverless::Api). Provides a local testing environment (sam local), simplified deployment (sam deploy), and pipeline creation (sam pipeline). Transforms into standard CloudFormation at deployment.
