# ClusterIP Service

> <- Back to [[K8s Networking]]

The default service type that exposes a service on a cluster-internal IP. Only accessible from within the cluster. Provides a stable IP and DNS name (service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local) that load-balances across healthy pod endpoints. Used for internal service-to-service communication.
