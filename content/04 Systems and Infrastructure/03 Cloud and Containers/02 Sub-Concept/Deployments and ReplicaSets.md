# Deployments and ReplicaSets

> <- Back to [[Kubernetes]]

Deployments manage the desired state of a set of pods: replica count, update strategy (rolling update, recreate), and pod template. They create and manage ReplicaSets, which ensure the specified number of pod replicas are running. Rolling updates replace pods gradually with zero downtime.
