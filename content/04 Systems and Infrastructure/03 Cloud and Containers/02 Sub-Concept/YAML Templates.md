# YAML Templates

> <- Back to [[Google Cloud Deployment Manager]]

GCP Deployment Manager uses YAML files to define resources declaratively. Each resource specifies a type (e.g., compute.v1.instance) and properties. Templates support references between resources and schema validation. Simpler than Jinja2/Python templates but less flexible.
