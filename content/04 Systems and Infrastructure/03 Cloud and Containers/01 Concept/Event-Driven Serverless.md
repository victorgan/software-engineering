# Event-Driven Serverless

> <- Back to [[Serverless]]

Functions are triggered by events from various sources: HTTP requests (API Gateway), message queue messages (SQS, Pub/Sub), file uploads (S3, GCS), database changes (DynamoDB Streams), and scheduled triggers (cron). The cloud provider handles the event routing and scaling.

## Key Properties

- [[HTTP Triggers]]
- [[Queue and Stream Triggers]]
- [[Scheduled Triggers]]

## Related

- [[Functions as a Service]] (FaaS provides the compute)
- [[Pub Sub]] (pub/sub events trigger functions)
