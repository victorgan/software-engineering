# Docker

> <- Back to [[Containerization]]

The most widely used container platform. Docker packages applications into images (immutable templates built from Dockerfiles in layers) and runs them as containers (isolated processes). Multi-stage builds reduce image size by separating build and runtime dependencies.

## Key Properties

- [[Docker Images and Layers]]
- [[Dockerfile]]
- [[Multi-Stage Builds]]

## Related

- [[Container Registries]] (store and distribute images)
- [[Namespaces]] (Docker uses Linux namespaces for isolation)
- [[cgroups]] (Docker uses cgroups for resource limits)
