# GitOps

> <- Back to [[Infrastructure as Code]]

Using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configuration. Changes are made via pull requests, and automated tools (Argo CD, Flux) reconcile the cluster state to match the Git repository. Provides audit trails, easy rollbacks, and developer-friendly workflows.
