# Async Await Pattern

> <- Back to [[Coroutines]]

A language-level syntax for writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous. `async` marks a function as a coroutine, `await` suspends it until the awaited operation completes. Used in Python, JavaScript, Rust, Kotlin, and C# for non-blocking I/O.
