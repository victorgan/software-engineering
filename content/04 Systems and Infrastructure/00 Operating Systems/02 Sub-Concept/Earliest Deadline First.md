# Earliest Deadline First

> <- Back to [[Real-Time Scheduling]]

A dynamic-priority algorithm that always schedules the task with the nearest deadline. Optimal for uniprocessor systems — can achieve 100% CPU utilization while meeting all deadlines (if the system is schedulable). More complex to implement than rate monotonic.
