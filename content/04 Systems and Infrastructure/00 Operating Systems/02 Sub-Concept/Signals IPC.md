# Signals IPC

> <- Back to [[Inter-Process Communication (IPC)]]

Asynchronous notifications sent to a process to notify it of an event. Limited to a small set of predefined signal types (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGHUP, etc.). Cannot carry data beyond the signal number. Used for process control rather than data transfer.
