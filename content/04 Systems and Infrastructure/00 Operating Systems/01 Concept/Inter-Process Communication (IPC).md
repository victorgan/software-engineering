# Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

> <- Back to [[Processes and Threads]]

Mechanisms that allow processes to exchange data and coordinate their actions. Since processes have separate memory spaces, they need explicit IPC mechanisms to communicate.

## Key Properties

- [[Pipes]]
- [[Sockets]]
- [[Shared Memory IPC]]
- [[Message Queues IPC]]
- [[Signals IPC]]

## Related

- [[Process]] (IPC bridges the isolation between processes)
- [[Thread]] (threads share memory, reducing IPC need)
