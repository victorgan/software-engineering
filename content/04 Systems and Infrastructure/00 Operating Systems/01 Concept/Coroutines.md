# Coroutines

> <- Back to [[Processes and Threads]]

Cooperative multitasking primitives that can suspend and resume execution at defined yield points. Unlike preemptive threads, coroutines voluntarily give up control, making them predictable and efficient. Examples include Python async/await and Kotlin coroutines.

## Key Properties

- [[Yield Points]]
