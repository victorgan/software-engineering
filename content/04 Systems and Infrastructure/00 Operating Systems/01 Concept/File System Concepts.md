# File System Concepts

> <- Back to [[File Systems]]

The fundamental building blocks of file systems: inodes store file metadata, directories map names to inodes, file descriptors are process-level handles for open files, and links (hard and soft) provide multiple paths to the same data.

## Key Properties

- [[Inodes]]
- [[File Descriptors]]
- [[Hard and Soft Links]]
