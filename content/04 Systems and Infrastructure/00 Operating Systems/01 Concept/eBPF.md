# eBPF

> <- Back to [[Linux Internals]]

Extended Berkeley Packet Filter — a technology that allows running sandboxed programs in the Linux kernel without modifying kernel source or loading kernel modules. Used for high-performance networking, observability (tracing, profiling), and security enforcement. Programs are verified for safety before execution.

## Key Properties

- [[Kernel Tracing]]
- [[Network Filtering]]
- [[Safety Verification]]
