# Thread

> <- Back to [[Processes and Threads]]

Lightweight execution unit within a process that shares the process's memory space. Threads enable concurrency within a single process, allowing multiple tasks to run in parallel while sharing heap memory, file descriptors, and other resources.

## Key Properties

- [[Shared Memory]]
- [[Lightweight Execution]]
- [[Thread Stack]]

## Related

- [[Process]] (heavier-weight alternative with isolation)
- [[Green Threads and Fibers]] (user-space threads)
- [[Context Switching]] (faster between threads than processes)
