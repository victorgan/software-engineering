# Green Threads and Fibers

> <- Back to [[Processes and Threads]]

User-space threads managed by the runtime rather than the OS kernel. They enable massive concurrency (millions of lightweight threads) with cooperative scheduling. Examples include Go goroutines and Erlang processes.

## Key Properties

- [[User-Space Scheduling]]
- [[Cooperative Scheduling]]
- [[Lightweight Concurrency]]

## Related

- [[Thread]] (OS-level counterpart)
- [[Coroutines]] (similar cooperative model)
