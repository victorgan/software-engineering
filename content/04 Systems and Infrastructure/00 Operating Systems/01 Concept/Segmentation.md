# Segmentation

> <- Back to [[Memory Management]]

Divides memory into variable-size segments based on logical groupings (code, stack, heap, data). Each segment has a base address and limit. Provides a more natural view of memory than paging but suffers from external fragmentation. Modern systems primarily use paging, with segmentation playing a minor role.

## Key Properties

- [[Variable-Size Segments]]
- [[Logical Grouping]]
- [[External Fragmentation]]
