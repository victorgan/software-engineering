> <- Back to [[Memory Management]]

An abstraction that gives each process the illusion of a large, contiguous, private address space. The OS and hardware translate virtual addresses to physical addresses, enabling memory isolation, overcommitment, and efficient sharing.

## Key Properties

- [[Address Translation]]
- [[Page Tables]]
