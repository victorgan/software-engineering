The layered models that describe how network communication works. The OSI model has 7 layers (theoretical reference); the TCP/IP model has 4 layers (practical implementation). Each layer handles a specific aspect of communication, from physical signals to application protocols.

## Concepts

- [[Physical Layer]]
- [[Data Link Layer]]
- [[Network Layer]]
- [[Transport Layer]]
