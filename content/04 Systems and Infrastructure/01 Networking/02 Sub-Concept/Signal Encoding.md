# Signal Encoding

> <- Back to [[Physical Layer]]

How digital data (bits) is represented as physical signals. Includes line coding (NRZ, Manchester encoding), modulation (amplitude, frequency, phase), and multiplexing (TDM, FDM, WDM). The encoding scheme determines data rate, error detection capability, and clock synchronization.
