# Authoritative Name Servers

> <- Back to [[Resolution Process]]

The DNS servers that hold the actual DNS records for a domain and provide definitive answers. Managed by the domain owner or their DNS provider (Route 53, Cloudflare DNS, etc.). Typically deployed in pairs (primary/secondary) for redundancy, with zone transfers keeping them in sync.
