# UDP Protocol

> <- Back to [[Transport Layer]]

User Datagram Protocol — connectionless, unreliable transport with minimal overhead. No handshake, no guaranteed delivery, no ordering. Lower latency than TCP. Ideal for real-time applications (video streaming, gaming, VoIP, DNS queries) where speed matters more than reliability.
