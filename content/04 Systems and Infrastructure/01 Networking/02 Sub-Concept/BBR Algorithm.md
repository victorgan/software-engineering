# BBR Algorithm

> <- Back to [[Congestion Control]]

Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time — a congestion control algorithm developed by Google. Unlike loss-based algorithms (Reno, Cubic), BBR models the network path to find the optimal sending rate. Achieves higher throughput and lower latency, especially on lossy networks. Used by YouTube and Google Cloud.
