# Cache-Control Header

> <- Back to [[HTTP Headers]]

Directs caching behavior for browsers and intermediaries. Key directives: max-age (cache duration in seconds), no-cache (revalidate before using), no-store (never cache), public/private (shared vs browser-only cache), immutable (never revalidate). Proper cache headers are critical for performance and correctness.
