# Persistent Connections

> <- Back to [[Keep-Alive]]

TCP connections that remain open after a request-response exchange, allowing multiple requests to reuse the same connection. Eliminates the overhead of repeated three-way handshakes and slow start phases. Default behavior in HTTP/1.1 (Connection: keep-alive).
