# DNS-over-HTTPS

> <- Back to [[DNS Security]]

DoH encrypts DNS queries by sending them as HTTPS requests to a resolver (e.g., https://dns.google/dns-query). Prevents ISPs and network operators from seeing DNS queries. Uses port 443, making it indistinguishable from regular HTTPS traffic. Supported by major browsers and resolvers.
