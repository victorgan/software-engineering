# Auth and Routing

> <- Back to [[API Gateway]]

The API gateway centralizes authentication (validating JWT tokens, API keys, OAuth) and authorization (checking permissions) before routing requests to backend services. This offloads security concerns from individual services and provides a single enforcement point. Routing can be path-based, header-based, or method-based.
