# CRUD Mapping

> <- Back to [[HTTP Methods]]

The conventional mapping of HTTP methods to CRUD operations in REST APIs: Create = POST, Read = GET, Update = PUT/PATCH, Delete = DELETE. PUT replaces the entire resource while PATCH applies a partial update. This mapping is a convention, not a specification requirement.
