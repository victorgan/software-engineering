# AWS CloudFront

> <- Back to [[CDN Providers]]

Amazon's CDN service that integrates tightly with AWS services (S3, ALB, Lambda@Edge, API Gateway). Supports custom SSL certificates, origin failover, real-time logs, and edge functions. Pricing is per-request and per-GB with regional variations. Good choice for AWS-native architectures.
