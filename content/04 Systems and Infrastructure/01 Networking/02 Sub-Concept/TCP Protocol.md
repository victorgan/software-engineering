# TCP Protocol

> <- Back to [[Transport Layer]]

Transmission Control Protocol — provides reliable, ordered, error-checked delivery of bytes between applications. Uses sequence numbers, acknowledgments, checksums, and retransmissions. Connection-oriented (requires handshake). Ideal for web traffic, file transfer, and any data requiring integrity.
