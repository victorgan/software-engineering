# Session Management

> <- Back to [[Cookies and Sessions]]

Server-side state associated with a client, identified by a session ID stored in a cookie. Session data can be stored in memory (single server), a shared store (Redis, database), or encoded in the cookie itself (JWT). Considerations include expiration, invalidation, and session fixation attacks.
