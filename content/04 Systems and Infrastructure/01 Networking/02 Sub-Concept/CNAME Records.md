# CNAME Records

> <- Back to [[Record Types]]

Canonical Name records create an alias from one domain to another (e.g., www.example.com CNAME example.com). The resolver follows the chain to find the final A/AAAA record. Cannot coexist with other record types at the same name. Cannot be used at the zone apex (root domain) in standard DNS.
