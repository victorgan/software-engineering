# TLS Encryption

> <- Back to [[Application Layer]]

Transport Layer Security — provides encryption, authentication, and integrity for network communication. TLS 1.3 simplified the handshake to 1-RTT (0-RTT for resumption). Uses certificates for server authentication and supports mutual TLS (mTLS) for client authentication. Underlies HTTPS.
