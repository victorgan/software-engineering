# ARP Protocol

> <- Back to [[Data Link Layer]]

Address Resolution Protocol — maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network. When a host needs to send a packet to a local IP, it broadcasts an ARP request; the host with that IP responds with its MAC address. Results are cached in the ARP table. Vulnerable to ARP spoofing attacks.
