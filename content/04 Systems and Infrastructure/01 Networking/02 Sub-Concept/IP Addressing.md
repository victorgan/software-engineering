# IP Addressing

> <- Back to [[Network Layer]]

IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), providing ~4.3 billion addresses (exhausted). IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:db8::1), providing a virtually unlimited address space. Private IP ranges (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x) are used within local networks and require NAT for internet access.
