# Server Push

> <- Back to [[HTTP 2]]

Allows the server to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested (e.g., pushing CSS and JS when HTML is requested). Aims to eliminate round trips for known dependencies. In practice, often conflicts with browser caching and has been deprecated in some implementations.
