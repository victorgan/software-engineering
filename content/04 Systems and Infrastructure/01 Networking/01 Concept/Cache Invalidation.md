# Cache Invalidation

> <- Back to [[CDN]]

Removing or updating stale content from CDN edge caches. Strategies include: purging specific URLs, using versioned URLs (style.v2.css), cache-control headers with appropriate max-age/s-maxage, and cache tags for grouped invalidation. "There are only two hard things in CS: cache invalidation and naming things."
