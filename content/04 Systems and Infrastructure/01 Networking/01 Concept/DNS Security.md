# DNS Security

> <- Back to [[DNS]]

Protecting DNS from attacks and surveillance. DNSSEC adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records to prevent spoofing. DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) encrypts DNS queries in HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping. DNS-over-TLS (DoT) encrypts queries using TLS. These address the fact that traditional DNS is unencrypted and unauthenticated.
