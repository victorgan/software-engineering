# NAT Firewalls and VPNs

> <- Back to [[Other Networking Topics]]

Network infrastructure fundamentals for security and connectivity. NAT (Network Address Translation) maps private IPs to public IPs. Firewalls filter traffic based on rules (iptables, security groups). VPNs create encrypted tunnels for secure remote access. WireGuard is a modern, fast VPN protocol.
