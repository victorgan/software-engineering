# Network Layer

> <- Back to [[OSI and TCP-IP Model]]

Handles routing packets across different networks from source to destination. IP (Internet Protocol) is the core protocol — IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit. Routers operate at this layer, making forwarding decisions based on destination IP and routing tables.

## Key Properties

- [[IP Addressing]]
- [[Routing]]
- [[ICMP]]
- [[Subnetting and CIDR]]

- [[Data Link Layer]] (local delivery within a network)
- [[Transport Layer]] (adds reliability on top of IP)
