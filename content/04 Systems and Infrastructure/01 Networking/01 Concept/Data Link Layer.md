# Data Link Layer

> <- Back to [[OSI and TCP-IP Model]]

Handles node-to-node data transfer on the same network segment. Frames data with MAC addresses for local delivery, detects transmission errors, and manages access to the shared medium. Ethernet is the dominant protocol at this layer; switches operate here.

## Key Properties

- [[Ethernet Frames]]
- [[MAC Addresses]]
- [[ARP Protocol]]

## Related

- [[Physical Layer]] (transmits the frames as bits)
- [[Network Layer]] (routes across network boundaries)
