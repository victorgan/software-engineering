# Resolution Process

> <- Back to [[DNS]]

The hierarchical process of resolving a domain name to an IP address. The recursive resolver queries root name servers, then TLD (top-level domain) servers, then authoritative name servers for the specific domain. Results are cached at each level based on TTL values.

## Key Properties

- [[Recursive Resolver]]
- [[Root and TLD Servers]]
- [[Authoritative Name Servers]]
