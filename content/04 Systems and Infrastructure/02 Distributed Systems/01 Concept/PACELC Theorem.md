# PACELC Theorem

> <- Back to [[Fundamental Concepts]]

Extends CAP: if there is a Partition, choose between Availability and Consistency (PAC); Else, when running normally, choose between Latency and Consistency (ELC). This captures the reality that even without partitions, there is a tradeoff between response time and consistency strength.

## Key Properties

- [[Partition Tradeoff]]
- [[Latency vs Consistency]]
- [[Normal Operation Tradeoffs]]

## Related

- [[CAP Theorem]] (PACELC extends CAP)
- [[Eventual Consistency]] (often chosen for lower latency)
