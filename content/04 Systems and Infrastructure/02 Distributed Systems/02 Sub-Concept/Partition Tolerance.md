# Partition Tolerance

> <- Back to [[CAP Theorem]]

The ability of a system to continue operating when network messages between nodes are lost or delayed. Network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems (hardware failures, network congestion, misconfiguration), so partition tolerance is not truly optional — the real choice is between C and A.
