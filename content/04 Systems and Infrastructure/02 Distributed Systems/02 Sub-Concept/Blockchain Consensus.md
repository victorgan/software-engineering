# Blockchain Consensus

> <- Back to [[Byzantine Fault Tolerance]]

Blockchain networks use BFT variants for consensus in adversarial environments. Proof of Work (Bitcoin) uses computational puzzles, Proof of Stake (Ethereum) uses economic incentives. These are BFT solutions optimized for open, permissionless networks where node identities are unknown.
