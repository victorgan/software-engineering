# Event Broadcasting

> <- Back to [[Pub Sub]]

Publishing domain events (OrderCreated, UserSignedUp, PaymentProcessed) to topics that any interested service can subscribe to. The publisher does not need to know or care about subscribers. New consumers can be added without modifying the publisher. Foundation of event-driven architecture.
