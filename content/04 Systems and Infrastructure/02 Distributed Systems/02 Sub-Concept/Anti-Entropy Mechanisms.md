# Anti-Entropy Mechanisms

> <- Back to [[Eventual Consistency]]

Background processes that detect and resolve inconsistencies between replicas. Read repair fixes inconsistencies during normal reads. Merkle trees efficiently compare data between replicas. Gossip protocols spread updates probabilistically. These mechanisms drive convergence in eventually consistent systems.
