# Session Guarantees

> <- Back to [[Read-Your-Writes]]

A set of per-client consistency guarantees: read-your-writes (see your own updates), monotonic reads (never go backward in time), monotonic writes (writes from a session are applied in order), and writes-follow-reads (writes incorporate previously read data). Provides a usable experience on eventually consistent systems.
