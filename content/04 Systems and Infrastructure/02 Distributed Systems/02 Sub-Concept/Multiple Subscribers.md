# Multiple Subscribers

> <- Back to [[Pub Sub]]

Each message published to a topic is delivered to all subscribers independently. Different subscribers can process the same event differently (e.g., one updates a search index, another sends a notification, another updates analytics). Enables event-driven architectures with loose coupling.
