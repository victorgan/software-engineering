# Zero Trust Architecture

> <- Back to [[Network Security]]

A security model that never trusts and always verifies, regardless of network location. Every request must be authenticated and authorized, even from within the corporate network. Zero trust assumes the network is already compromised and verifies every connection.

## Key Properties

- [[Never Trust Always Verify]]
- [[Identity-Based Access]]
- [[Continuous Verification]]
