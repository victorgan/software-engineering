# Purple Team Collaboration

> <- Back to [[Red Team vs Blue Team]]

A collaborative approach where red team and blue team work together to improve security. The red team shares attack techniques and findings; the blue team uses this to improve detection and response. This feedback loop accelerates security maturity more effectively than adversarial red/blue exercises alone.
