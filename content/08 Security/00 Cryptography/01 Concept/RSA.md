# RSA

> <- Back to [[Asymmetric Encryption]]

An asymmetric encryption algorithm based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. RSA requires 2048+ bit keys for adequate security. While still widely used, RSA is being replaced by Elliptic Curve Cryptography for many applications due to ECC's smaller key sizes and better performance.
