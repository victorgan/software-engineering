# Hash Algorithms

> <- Back to [[Hashing]]

Widely used cryptographic hash algorithms: SHA-256 (standard, widely supported), SHA-3 (latest NIST standard, different internal structure), BLAKE2 (faster than SHA-256), and BLAKE3 (parallel, extremely fast). MD5 and SHA-1 are broken and should not be used for security.

## Key Properties

- [[SHA-256]]
- [[SHA-3]]
- [[BLAKE2 and BLAKE3]]
