# TLS Handshake

> <- Back to [[TLS and SSL]]

The process of establishing a secure TLS connection: Client Hello (supported cipher suites), Server Hello (chosen cipher suite + certificate), key exchange, and verification. TLS 1.3 reduces this to a single round trip (1-RTT), with optional 0-RTT resumption.
