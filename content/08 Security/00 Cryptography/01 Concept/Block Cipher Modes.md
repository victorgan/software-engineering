# Block Cipher Modes

> <- Back to [[Symmetric Encryption]]

Modes of operation that define how a block cipher encrypts data larger than one block. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), CTR (Counter Mode), and GCM (Galois/Counter Mode, which provides authenticated encryption). GCM is preferred as it provides both encryption and integrity.

## Key Properties

- [[CBC Mode]]
- [[CTR Mode]]
- [[GCM Authenticated Encryption]]
