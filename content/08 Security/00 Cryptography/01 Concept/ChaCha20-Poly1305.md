# ChaCha20-Poly1305

> <- Back to [[Symmetric Encryption]]

A stream cipher (ChaCha20) combined with an authenticator (Poly1305), providing authenticated encryption. An alternative to AES-GCM that performs better on devices without AES hardware acceleration. Used in TLS 1.3, WireGuard, and many modern protocols.
