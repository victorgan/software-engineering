# Certificates

> <- Back to [[TLS and SSL]]

X.509 digital certificates that bind a public key to an identity, signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). Certificates form a chain of trust from the server's certificate through intermediate CAs to a trusted root CA. Browsers and operating systems maintain lists of trusted root CAs.
