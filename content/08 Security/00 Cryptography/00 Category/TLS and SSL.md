# TLS and SSL

**Back:** [[Cryptography]]

Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides encrypted, authenticated communication over networks. TLS 1.3 is the current standard, offering reduced handshake latency and stronger cipher suites. SSL is the deprecated predecessor. TLS protects data in transit across the internet.

- [[TLS Handshake]]
- [[TLS 1.3]]
- [[Certificates]]
