# Collision Resistance

> <- Back to [[Hash Properties]]

The property that it is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output. MD5 and SHA-1 have been broken (collisions found) and should not be used for security purposes. SHA-256 and SHA-3 remain collision resistant.
