# Chain of Trust

> <- Back to [[Certificates]]

The hierarchical chain from a server's certificate to an intermediate CA certificate to a trusted root CA certificate. Each certificate in the chain is signed by the next higher authority. Clients verify the chain back to a root CA in their trust store to establish authenticity.
