# Stored XSS

> <- Back to [[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)]]

XSS where the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (in a database, comment field, forum post) and served to every user who views the affected page. More dangerous than reflected XSS because it does not require the victim to click a crafted link.
