> <- Back to [[Threat Modeling]]

Evaluating identified threats by Likelihood (probability of exploitation) multiplied by Impact (damage if exploited) to prioritize mitigations. High-likelihood, high-impact risks are addressed first. Risk assessment turns an unbounded security problem into a prioritized action plan.
