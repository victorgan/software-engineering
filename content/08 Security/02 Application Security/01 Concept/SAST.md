# SAST

> <- Back to [[Secure Development Practices]]

Static Application Security Testing analyzes source code for vulnerabilities without executing it. Tools like Semgrep, SonarQube, and CodeQL find security issues early in the development lifecycle at low cost. SAST runs in CI/CD and provides fast feedback on code changes.

## Key Properties

- [[Source Code Analysis]]
- [[CI/CD Integration]]
