# JWT Structure

> <- Back to [[JWT (JSON Web Tokens)]]

A JWT consists of three base64url-encoded parts separated by dots: Header (algorithm and type), Payload (claims), and Signature (verification). The header declares the signing algorithm, the payload carries the claims, and the signature ensures integrity.
