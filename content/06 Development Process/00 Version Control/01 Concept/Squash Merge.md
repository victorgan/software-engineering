# Squash Merge

> <- Back to [[Branching and Merging]]

Compress an entire branch into a single commit on the target branch. Produces the cleanest main history but loses individual commit history from the branch. Good when branch commits are messy but the overall change is cohesive.

## Key Properties

- [[Single Commit Result]]
- [[Clean Main History]]
- [[Lost Branch History]]

## Related

- [[Merge Commits]] (preserves all history)
- [[Rebase]] (preserves individual commits)
