# Rebase

> <- Back to [[Branching and Merging]]

Linear history by replaying commits on top of the target branch. Creates new commit hashes for replayed commits. Produces a clean, linear history but rewrites history (never rebase shared/public branches).

## Key Properties

- [[Commit Replay]]
- [[Linear History]]
- [[History Rewriting]]

## Related

- [[Merge Commits]] (alternative: preserves history)
- [[The DAG]] (rebase rewrites the graph)
