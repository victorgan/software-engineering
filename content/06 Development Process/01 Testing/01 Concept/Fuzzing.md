# Fuzzing

> <- Back to [[Advanced Testing Techniques]]

Random or intelligent input generation to find crashes and security vulnerabilities. Fuzzers like AFL and libFuzzer automatically explore code paths with generated inputs, discovering buffer overflows, assertion failures, and unexpected behavior.

## Key Properties

- [[Input Generation]]
- [[Crash Detection]]
- [[Coverage-Guided Fuzzing]]
