# Test Maintenance

> <- Back to [[Test Strategy]]

Avoiding brittle tests by testing behavior, not implementation. Tests coupled to implementation details break when code is refactored, creating maintenance burden. Good tests survive refactoring and only break when behavior changes.

## Key Properties

- [[Behavior-Focused Tests]]
- [[Refactoring Resilience]]
- [[Test Deduplication]]
