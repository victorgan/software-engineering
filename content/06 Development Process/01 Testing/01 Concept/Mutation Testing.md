# Mutation Testing

> <- Back to [[Advanced Testing Techniques]]

Modify code to verify tests catch bugs. Mutation testing introduces small changes (mutations) to the code and checks whether the test suite detects them. Surviving mutants indicate gaps in test coverage. Tools include PIT (Java) and Stryker (JS).

## Key Properties

- [[Mutant Generation]]
- [[Mutation Score]]
- [[Coverage Gap Detection]]
