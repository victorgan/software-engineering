> <- Back to [[Integration Testing]]

Testing a service with its real internal dependencies but mocked external services. Strikes a balance between unit and E2E tests — realistic enough to catch integration issues, fast enough to run frequently.

- [[Internal Dependencies Real]]
- [[External Dependencies Mocked]]
- [[Service-Level Testing]]

## Related
