> <- Back to [[Continuous Integration]]

Caching, parallelism, incremental builds, and affected-only testing. Slow pipelines reduce developer productivity and discourage frequent integration. Optimize by caching dependencies, running stages in parallel, and only testing affected code.

## Key Properties

- [[Dependency Caching]]
- [[Parallel Stages]]
- [[Affected-Only Testing]]
