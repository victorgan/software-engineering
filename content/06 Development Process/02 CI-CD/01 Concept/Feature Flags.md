# Feature Flags

> <- Back to [[Deployment Strategies]]

Decouple deployment from release. Feature flags (LaunchDarkly, Unleash, Flagsmith) allow code to be deployed but not activated for users. Enable trunk-based development, A/B testing, gradual rollouts, and instant kill switches.

## Key Properties

- [[Deployment-Release Decoupling]]
- [[Gradual Rollout]]
- [[Kill Switch]]

## Related

- [[Trunk-Based Development]] (enabled by feature flags)
- [[A-B Testing Deployment]] (uses feature flags)
