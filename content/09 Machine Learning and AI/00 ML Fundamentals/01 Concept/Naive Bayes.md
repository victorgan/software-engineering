# Naive Bayes

> <- Back to [[Classical ML Algorithms]]

Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with a strong (naive) independence assumption between features. Surprisingly effective for text classification despite the assumption rarely holding.

## Key Properties

- Bayes' theorem: P(y|x) = P(x|y) * P(y) / P(x)
- Feature independence assumption
- Variants: Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli
