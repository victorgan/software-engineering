# Reinforcement Learning

> <- Back to [[Learning Types]]

An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving reward signals. Used in robotics, game playing, and LLM alignment (RLHF).

## Key Properties

- [[States Actions and Rewards]]
- [[RLHF]]

## Core Components

- **Agent** -- the learner/decision maker
- **Environment** -- what the agent interacts with
- **State** -- current situation
- **Action** -- what the agent can do
- **Reward** -- feedback signal
- **Policy** -- strategy mapping states to actions

## Key Algorithms

- Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient methods (REINFORCE, PPO, A3C)
