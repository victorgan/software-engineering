# Bayesian Methods

> <- Back to [[Classical ML Algorithms]]

Probabilistic approaches that model uncertainty by maintaining distributions over parameters rather than point estimates. Provides principled uncertainty quantification and works well with small datasets.

## Key Properties

- Prior and posterior distributions
- Gaussian processes for regression
- Probabilistic programming (PyMC, Stan, NumPyro)
