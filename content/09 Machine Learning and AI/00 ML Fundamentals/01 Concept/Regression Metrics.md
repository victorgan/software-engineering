# Regression Metrics

> <- Back to [[Model Evaluation]]

Metrics for evaluating models that predict continuous values. Each metric has different sensitivity to outliers and different interpretability.

## Key Metrics

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** -- average of squared differences, penalizes large errors
- **RMSE (Root MSE)** -- same units as target, more interpretable
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** -- average of absolute differences, robust to outliers
- **R-squared** -- proportion of variance explained
- **Adjusted R-squared** -- R-squared penalized for number of features
