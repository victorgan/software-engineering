# K-Nearest Neighbors

> <- Back to [[Classical ML Algorithms]]

Instance-based learning that classifies new points based on the majority vote of their k nearest neighbors. No training phase -- all computation happens at prediction time.

## Key Properties

- Instance-based (lazy) learning
- Distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine
- Choice of k controls bias-variance tradeoff
