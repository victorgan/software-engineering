# Unsupervised Learning

> <- Back to [[Learning Types]]

Discovering hidden structure in data without labeled examples. Used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

## Key Properties

- [[Clustering]]
- [[Dimensionality Reduction]]
- [[Anomaly Detection]]

## How It Works

The model finds patterns, groupings, or compressed representations in data without being told what to look for. No target variable is provided.
