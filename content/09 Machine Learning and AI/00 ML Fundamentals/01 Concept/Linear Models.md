# Linear Models

> <- Back to [[Classical ML Algorithms]]

Models that make predictions using a linear combination of input features. Simple, interpretable, and fast -- often the first model to try.

## Key Properties

- [[L1 Regularization (Lasso)]]
- [[L2 Regularization (Ridge)]]

## Types

- **Linear Regression** -- continuous output, minimize MSE
- **Logistic Regression** -- binary classification, sigmoid activation, minimize cross-entropy
- **Regularized variants** -- L1 (Lasso, sparsity), L2 (Ridge, shrinkage), Elastic Net (both)
