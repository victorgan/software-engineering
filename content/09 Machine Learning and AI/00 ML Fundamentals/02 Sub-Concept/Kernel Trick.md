# Kernel Trick

> <- Back to [[Support Vector Machines]]

Implicitly maps data to a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable, without actually computing the transformation. Common kernels: RBF (Gaussian), polynomial, sigmoid. Enables SVMs to learn nonlinear decision boundaries efficiently.
