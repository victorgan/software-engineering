# VAEs

> <- Back to [[Generative Models]]

Variational Autoencoders. Learn a compressed latent space representation of data. Encode input to a distribution in latent space, sample from it, decode back. Loss combines reconstruction quality and KL divergence (regularize latent space). Enable interpolation and controlled generation.
