# Deep Learning Frameworks

> <- Back to [[Training at Scale]]

The software frameworks used to build, train, and deploy neural networks.

## Key Frameworks

- **PyTorch** -- dynamic computation graphs, Pythonic, dominant in research and increasingly in production
- **JAX** -- NumPy on accelerators, functional transformations (vmap, jit, grad), used at Google/DeepMind
- **TensorFlow** -- static graphs (eager mode available), TensorFlow Serving, production-focused
- **Keras** -- high-level API, now multi-backend (TF, JAX, PyTorch)
