# EU AI Act

> <- Back to [[Responsible AI]]

The European Union's comprehensive AI regulation framework. Risk-based classification: unacceptable risk (banned, e.g., social scoring), high risk (strict requirements, e.g., medical, hiring), limited risk (transparency obligations), minimal risk (no restrictions). Requires transparency, human oversight, and documentation for high-risk systems.
