> <- Back to [[Bayesian Statistics]]

The updated probability distribution for a parameter after observing data. Computed via Bayes' theorem: posterior is proportional to likelihood times prior. The posterior combines prior beliefs with evidence from data. As more data is observed, the posterior becomes dominated by the likelihood.
