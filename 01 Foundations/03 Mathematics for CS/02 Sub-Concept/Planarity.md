# Planarity

> <- Back to [[Graph Theory]]

A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings. Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) relates vertices, edges, and faces. Kuratowski's theorem characterizes planar graphs. Planarity testing can be done in O(n) time. Important in circuit layout and map design.
