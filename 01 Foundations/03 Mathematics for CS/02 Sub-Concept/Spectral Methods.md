# Spectral Methods

> <- Back to [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors]]

Techniques based on the eigenvalues (spectrum) of matrices associated with graphs or operators. Spectral clustering uses eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix to partition data. PageRank uses the principal eigenvector of the web graph. Spectral methods connect linear algebra with graph theory and machine learning.
