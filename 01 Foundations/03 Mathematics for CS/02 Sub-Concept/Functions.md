# Functions

> <- Back to [[Set Theory]]

A mapping from each element of a domain to exactly one element of a codomain. Functions can be injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto), or bijective (both). Functions are the mathematical model for computation and are central to type theory and functional programming.
