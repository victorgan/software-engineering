# Arithmetic Coding

> <- Back to [[Compression]]

An entropy coding method that encodes an entire message as a single number in the interval [0, 1). Achieves compression closer to the entropy limit than Huffman coding, especially for skewed distributions. Used in modern compression standards like JPEG 2000 and H.265.
