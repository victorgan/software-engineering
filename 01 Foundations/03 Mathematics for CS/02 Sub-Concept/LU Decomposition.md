# LU Decomposition

> <- Back to [[Matrix Decompositions]]

Factorizes a matrix into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. Used for efficiently solving systems of linear equations, computing determinants, and matrix inversion. O(n^3) computation, but once factored, solving Ax = b becomes O(n^2) for each new b.
