# Checksums

> <- Back to [[Error Correction]]

A simple error-detection mechanism that computes a fixed-size value from a block of data. Common types include CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), MD5, and SHA checksums. Used to verify data integrity in network transmission, file downloads, and storage. Detect errors but generally cannot correct them.
