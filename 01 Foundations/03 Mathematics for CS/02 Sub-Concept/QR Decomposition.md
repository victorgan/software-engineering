# QR Decomposition

> <- Back to [[Matrix Decompositions]]

Factorizes a matrix into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R. Used for solving least squares problems, computing eigenvalues (QR algorithm), and numerical stability. More numerically stable than LU for certain problems. Computed via Gram-Schmidt, Householder reflections, or Givens rotations.
