# Linearity of Expectation

> <- Back to [[Expectation & Variance]]

E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y], regardless of whether X and Y are independent. This powerful property simplifies the analysis of complex random variables by decomposing them into simpler components. Key tool in analyzing randomized algorithms (e.g., expected number of comparisons in quicksort).
