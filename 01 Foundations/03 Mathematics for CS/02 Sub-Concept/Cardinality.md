# Cardinality

> <- Back to [[Set Theory]]

The size of a set, measuring the number of elements it contains. For infinite sets, cardinality distinguishes countably infinite sets (like the integers) from uncountably infinite sets (like the reals). Cantor's diagonalization proves the reals are uncountable, a result that connects to undecidability.
