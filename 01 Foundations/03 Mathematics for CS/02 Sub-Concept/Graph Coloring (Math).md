# Graph Coloring (Math)

> <- Back to [[Graph Theory]]

Assigning labels (colors) to graph elements subject to constraints. Vertex coloring requires no adjacent vertices share a color. The chromatic number is the minimum colors needed. The four-color theorem states every planar graph is 4-colorable. Applications in scheduling, register allocation, and frequency assignment.
