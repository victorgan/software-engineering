# Reed-Solomon

> <- Back to [[Error Correction]]

Error-correcting codes that work on blocks of data (symbols rather than individual bits). Can correct up to t symbol errors where 2t parity symbols are added. Used in CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray, QR codes, deep space communication, and RAID storage systems. Particularly effective against burst errors.
