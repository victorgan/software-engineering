> <- Back to [[Vectors and Matrices]]

Flipping a matrix over its diagonal, swapping rows and columns. The transpose of an m x n matrix is an n x m matrix. Properties: (AB)^T = B^T A^T. A symmetric matrix equals its transpose. Transpose is used in computing inner products, solving systems of equations, and in many matrix decompositions.
