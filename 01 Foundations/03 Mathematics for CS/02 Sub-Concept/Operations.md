# Operations

> <- Back to [[Vectors and Matrices]]

Fundamental operations on vectors and matrices: addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication is associative but not commutative. The computational cost of matrix multiplication (O(n^3) naive, O(n^2.37) theoretical best) is a central topic in algorithm design.
