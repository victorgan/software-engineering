# Shannon's Theorem

> <- Back to [[Channel Capacity]]

Also known as the noisy-channel coding theorem. States that for any communication channel with capacity C, it is possible to transmit information at any rate R < C with arbitrarily low error probability, given sufficiently long codes. Conversely, transmission at rates above C inevitably produces errors. The fundamental theorem of information theory.
