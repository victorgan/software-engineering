# Confidence Intervals

> <- Back to [[Statistical Inference]]

A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a specified probability (confidence level). A 95% confidence interval means that 95% of such intervals constructed from repeated sampling would contain the true value. Used in performance benchmarking and experimental reporting.
