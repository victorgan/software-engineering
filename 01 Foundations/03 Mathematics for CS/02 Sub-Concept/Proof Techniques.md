# Proof Techniques

> <- Back to [[Logic]]

Methods for establishing mathematical truth. Key techniques include mathematical induction (proving a base case and inductive step), proof by contradiction (assuming the negation leads to a contradiction), and the pigeonhole principle (if n+1 items go into n containers, at least one container has more than one). Essential for algorithm correctness proofs.
