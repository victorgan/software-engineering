# Huffman Coding

> <- Back to [[Classic Problems (Greedy)]]

A greedy algorithm for constructing an optimal prefix-free binary code for data compression. Assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols. Builds a binary tree bottom-up by repeatedly merging the two lowest-frequency nodes. O(n log n) time.
