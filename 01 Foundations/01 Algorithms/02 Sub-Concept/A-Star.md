# A*

> <- Back to [[Shortest Path]]

A best-first search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search toward the goal. Combines the actual cost from the start with an estimated cost to the goal. Optimal when the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates). Widely used in pathfinding and game AI.
