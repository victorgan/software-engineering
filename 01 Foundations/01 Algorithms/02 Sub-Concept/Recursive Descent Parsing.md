# Recursive Descent Parsing

> <- Back to [[Recursion Patterns]]

A top-down parsing technique where each non-terminal in the grammar is implemented as a recursive function. The parser descends through the grammar rules, consuming tokens as it matches them. Simple to implement and widely used in compilers and interpreters.
