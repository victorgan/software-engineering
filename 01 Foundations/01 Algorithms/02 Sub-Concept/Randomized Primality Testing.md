# Randomized Primality Testing

> <- Back to [[Monte Carlo]]

Probabilistic algorithms for testing whether a number is prime. Miller-Rabin is the most widely used Monte Carlo primality test, with configurable error probability. Essential in cryptographic key generation where deterministic tests would be too slow for large numbers.
