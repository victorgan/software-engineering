# Cardinality Estimation

> <- Back to [[HyperLogLog]]

Estimating the number of distinct elements in a dataset without storing all elements. HyperLogLog uses O(log log n) space to estimate cardinality with a typical error of about 2%. Used in databases, network monitoring, and big data analytics for counting unique visitors, IPs, or queries.
