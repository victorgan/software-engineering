# Kosaraju's Algorithm

> <- Back to [[Strongly Connected Components]]

A two-pass DFS algorithm for finding strongly connected components. First pass computes finish times, second pass processes vertices in reverse finish order on the transposed graph. O(V + E) time, conceptually simpler than [[Tarjan's Algorithm]].
