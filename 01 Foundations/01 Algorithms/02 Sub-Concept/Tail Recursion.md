# Tail Recursion

> <- Back to [[Recursion Patterns]]

A recursive call that is the last operation in a function. Tail-recursive functions can be optimized by the compiler into iterative loops (tail call optimization), eliminating stack overflow risk and reducing memory usage. Supported in languages like Scheme and Scala.
