# Strassen's Matrix Multiplication

> <- Back to [[Divide and Conquer]]

A divide-and-conquer algorithm that multiplies two n x n matrices in O(n^2.807) time instead of the naive O(n^3). Reduces the number of recursive multiplications from 8 to 7 per level by clever algebraic rearrangement of submatrix products.
