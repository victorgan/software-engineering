# Bisect Variants

> <- Back to [[Binary Search]]

Variations of binary search that find boundaries rather than exact matches. Includes bisect-left (leftmost insertion point), bisect-right (rightmost insertion point), and variants for finding first/last occurrence of a value. Available in standard libraries (e.g., Python's bisect module).
