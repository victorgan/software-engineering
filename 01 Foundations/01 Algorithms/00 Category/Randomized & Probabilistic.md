# Randomized & Probabilistic

**Back:** [[Algorithms]]

Algorithms that use randomness as part of their logic. They can provide simpler, faster, or more space-efficient solutions than deterministic alternatives, sometimes at the cost of a small probability of error or variable runtime.

## Concepts

- [[Monte Carlo]]
- [[Las Vegas]]
- [[Reservoir Sampling]]
- [[HyperLogLog]]
