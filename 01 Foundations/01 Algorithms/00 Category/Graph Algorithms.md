# Graph Algorithms

**Back:** [[Algorithms]]

Algorithms that operate on graph structures to solve problems like connectivity, shortest paths, and network flow. Graph algorithms are essential in networking, social networks, mapping, and many optimization problems.

## Concepts

- [[Traversal]]
- [[Shortest Path]]
- [[Minimum Spanning Tree]]
- [[Network Flow]]
- [[Strongly Connected Components]]
- [[Cycle Detection]]
