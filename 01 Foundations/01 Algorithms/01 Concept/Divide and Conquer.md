# Divide and Conquer

> <- Back to [[Backtracking & Recursion]]

An algorithm design paradigm that breaks a problem into smaller independent subproblems, solves each recursively, and combines results. Many fundamental algorithms follow this pattern.

## Key Properties

- [[Merge Sort (D&C)]]
- [[Quick Sort (D&C)]]
- [[Closest Pair of Points]]
- [[Strassen's Matrix Multiplication]]

## Related
