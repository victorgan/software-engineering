# Traversal

> <- Back to [[Graph Algorithms]]

Systematic methods for visiting all vertices and edges in a graph. Graph traversal is the foundation for many other graph algorithms.

## Key Properties

- [[BFS]]
- [[DFS]]
- [[Topological Sort]]

## Related

- [[Shortest Path]] (often built on traversal)
- [[Cycle Detection]] (uses traversal techniques)
