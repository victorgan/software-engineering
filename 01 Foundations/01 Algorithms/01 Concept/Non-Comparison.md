# Non-Comparison

> <- Back to [[Sorting]]

Sorting algorithms that do not rely on comparing elements. They exploit properties of the data (such as integer keys within a known range) to achieve better than O(n log n) time complexity.

## Key Properties

- [[Counting Sort]]
- [[Radix Sort]]
- [[Bucket Sort]]

## Related
