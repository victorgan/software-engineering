# Core Concepts (DP)

> <- Back to [[Dynamic Programming]]

The fundamental principles that make dynamic programming applicable to a problem. A problem must exhibit both overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure for DP to be effective.

## Key Properties

- [[Overlapping Subproblems]]
- [[Optimal Substructure]]
- [[Memoization vs Tabulation]]
