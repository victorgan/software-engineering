# Computational Complexity

**Back:** [[01 - Foundations MOC]]

Computational complexity is the study of the resources required to solve computational problems, primarily time and space. It classifies problems by their inherent difficulty and establishes relationships between problem classes, providing a framework for understanding what computers can and cannot efficiently compute.
