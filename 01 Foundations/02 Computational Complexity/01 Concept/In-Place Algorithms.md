# In-Place Algorithms

> <- Back to [[Space Complexity]]

Algorithms that use only O(1) extra space beyond the input. They transform the input using only a constant amount of additional memory, making them memory-efficient but sometimes more complex to implement.

## Key Properties

- [[O(1) Extra Space]]
