# NP-Complete

> <- Back to [[Complexity Classes]]

The hardest problems in NP: every problem in NP can be reduced to an NP-Complete problem in polynomial time. If any NP-Complete problem has a polynomial-time solution, then P = NP.

## Key Properties

- [[SAT]]
- [[3-SAT]]
- [[Traveling Salesman (Decision)]]
- [[Graph Coloring]]
