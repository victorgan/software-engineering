# Space-Time Tradeoffs

> <- Back to [[Space Complexity]]

The principle that reducing time complexity often requires more memory, and vice versa. This fundamental tradeoff guides algorithm and data structure selection in practice.

## Key Properties

- [[Hash Tables vs Sorted Arrays]]
- [[Memoization vs Recomputation]]

## Related

- [[Auxiliary Space]] (the space side of the tradeoff)
- [[In-Place Algorithms]] (extreme space optimization)
