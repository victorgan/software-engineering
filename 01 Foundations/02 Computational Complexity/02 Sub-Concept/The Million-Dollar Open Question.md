# The Million-Dollar Open Question

> <- Back to [[P vs NP Problem]]

One of the seven Millennium Prize Problems posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, with a $1 million prize for a correct solution. Most computer scientists believe P does not equal NP, but no proof exists in either direction. Resolving this question would have profound implications for cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence.
