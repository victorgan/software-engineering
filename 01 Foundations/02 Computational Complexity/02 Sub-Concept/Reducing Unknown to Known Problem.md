# Reducing Unknown to Known Problem

> <- Back to [[Problem Transformations]]

Transforming an instance of a new problem into an instance of a well-understood problem. If the transformation runs in polynomial time and the known problem has a known solution, this provides both an algorithm and a complexity classification for the new problem.
