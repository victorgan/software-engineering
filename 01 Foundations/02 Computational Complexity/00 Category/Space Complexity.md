# Space Complexity

**Back:** [[Computational Complexity]]

The amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of its input size. Space complexity analysis guides decisions about when to trade memory for speed and vice versa.

## Concepts

- [[Auxiliary Space]]
- [[In-Place Algorithms]]
- [[Space-Time Tradeoffs]]
