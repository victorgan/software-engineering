# Reductions

**Back:** [[Computational Complexity]]

A technique for proving relationships between problems by transforming one problem into another. Reductions are the primary tool for establishing NP-completeness and understanding the relative difficulty of computational problems.

## Concepts

- [[Polynomial-Time Reductions]]
- [[Problem Transformations]]
