# Queues

> ← Back to [[Linear Structures]]

First-In-First-Out (FIFO) collection. Elements are enqueued at the back and dequeued from the front. Foundation for BFS, task scheduling, and buffering.

## Key Properties

- [[FIFO]]
- [[Priority Queues]]
- [[Deques]]
- [[Circular Buffers]]

## Complexity

| Operation                | Time Complexity |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |
| Enqueue                  | O(1)            |
| Dequeue                  | O(1)            |
| Peek                     | O(1)            |
| Priority Queue — Insert  | O(log n)        |
| Priority Queue — Extract-min | O(log n)    |
