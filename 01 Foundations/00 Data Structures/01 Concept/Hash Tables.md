# Hash Tables

> ← Back to [[Hash-Based Structures]]

Maps keys to values using a hash function. The workhorse of fast lookups — nearly every language provides a built-in implementation (dict, HashMap, Map, object).

## Key Properties

- [[Hash Functions]]
- [[Collision Resolution]]
- [[Chaining]]
- [[Open Addressing]]

## Complexity

- **Average** — Insert O(1), Lookup O(1), Delete O(1).
- **Worst case** (all collisions) — O(n).

## Related

- [[Hash Sets]]
- [[Arrays]] (underlying storage)
- [[Bloom Filters]] (probabilistic variant)
