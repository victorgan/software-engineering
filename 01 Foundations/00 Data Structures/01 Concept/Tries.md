# Tries

> ← Back to [[Tree Structures]]

Tree structure where each node represents a character and paths from root to leaves represent strings. Optimized for prefix-based operations.

## Key Properties

- [[Autocomplete]]
- [[Spell-Checking]]
- [[IP Routing]]

## Complexity

| Operation          | Time Complexity |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Insert/Search/Delete | O(m) where m is key length |

Space can be high but compressed tries (radix trees) help.
