# Linked Lists

> ← Back to [[Linear Structures]]

Sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Trade random access for efficient insertion/deletion at any known position.

## Key Properties

- [[Singly Linked]]
- [[Doubly Linked]]
- [[Circular Linked List]]
- [[Pointer-Based Traversal]]

## Complexity

| Operation                    | Time Complexity |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Access                       | O(n)            |
| Search                       | O(n)            |
| Insert/Delete at known position | O(1)         |
| Insert/Delete with search    | O(n)            |
