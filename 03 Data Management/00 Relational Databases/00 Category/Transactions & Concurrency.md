**Back:** [[Relational Databases]]

Mechanisms for ensuring data integrity when multiple operations or users access the database simultaneously. ACID properties and isolation levels are fundamental to understanding how databases maintain correctness under concurrent access.

## Concepts

- [[ACID Properties]]
- [[Isolation Levels]]
- [[Concurrency Phenomena]]
- [[Locking]]
- [[MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)]]
- [[Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking]]
- [[Two-Phase Commit (2PC)]]
