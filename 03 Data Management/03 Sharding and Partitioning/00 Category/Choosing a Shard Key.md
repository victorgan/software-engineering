# Choosing a Shard Key

**Back:** [[Sharding and Partitioning]]

The shard key determines how data is distributed across shards. A poor choice leads to hotspots, cross-shard queries, and rebalancing problems. The shard key is the most critical decision in a sharded architecture.

## Concepts

- [[High Cardinality]]
- [[Even Distribution]]
- [[Query Alignment]]
- [[Immutability]]
- [[Compound Shard Keys]]
