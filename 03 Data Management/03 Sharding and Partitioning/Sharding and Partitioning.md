# Sharding and Partitioning

**Back:** [[03 - Data Management MOC]]

Partitioning splits data within a single database instance. Sharding distributes data across multiple database instances. Both reduce per-node data size; sharding also distributes load. See [[Distributed Systems]] for the theoretical foundations (CAP, consistency models, consensus).
