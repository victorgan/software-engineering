# Recurrent Neural Networks

**Back:** [[Deep Learning]]

Neural networks designed for sequential data, processing one element at a time while maintaining a hidden state. Largely superseded by Transformers but still relevant for certain time-series and streaming applications.

## Concepts

- [[Vanilla RNN]]
- [[LSTM]]
- [[GRU]]
- [[Bidirectional RNNs]]
