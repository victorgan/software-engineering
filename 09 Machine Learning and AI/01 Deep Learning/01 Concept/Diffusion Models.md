# Diffusion Models

> <- Back to [[Generative Models]]

Generate data by learning to reverse a gradual noising process. Start from pure noise and iteratively denoise to produce realistic outputs. State-of-the-art for image generation (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney). More stable training than GANs.
