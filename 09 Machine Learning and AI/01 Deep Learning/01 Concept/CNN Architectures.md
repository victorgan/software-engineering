# CNN Architectures

> <- Back to [[Convolutional Neural Networks]]

The evolution of CNN designs from simple to deep and efficient. Each architecture introduced key innovations that advanced the field.

## Key Architectures

- **LeNet** -- original CNN (Yann LeCun, 1998), digit recognition
- **AlexNet** -- deep CNN breakthrough on ImageNet (2012), ReLU, dropout
- **VGG** -- very deep with small 3x3 filters (2014)
- **ResNet** -- residual connections enabling 100+ layer networks (2015)
- **EfficientNet** -- compound scaling of depth, width, and resolution (2019)
- **ConvNeXt** -- modernized CNN competing with Vision Transformers (2022)
