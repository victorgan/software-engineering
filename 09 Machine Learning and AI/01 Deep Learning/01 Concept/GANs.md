# GANs

> <- Back to [[Generative Models]]

Generative Adversarial Networks. Two networks compete: a generator creates fake data, a discriminator tries to distinguish real from fake. Through adversarial training, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic outputs. Pioneered realistic image generation.
