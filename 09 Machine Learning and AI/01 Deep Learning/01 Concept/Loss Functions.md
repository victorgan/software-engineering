# Loss Functions

> <- Back to [[Neural Network Fundamentals]]

Functions that measure how far the model's predictions are from the true values. The loss is what backpropagation minimizes during training.

## Key Types

- **Cross-Entropy** -- standard for classification (binary and multi-class)
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** -- standard for regression
- **Hinge Loss** -- used in SVMs, margin-based
- **Contrastive Loss** -- for learning embeddings and similarity
