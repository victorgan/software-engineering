# Time Features

> <- Back to [[Feature Engineering]]

Extracting informative features from temporal data for time-series modeling and forecasting.

## Techniques

- **Lag Features** -- previous values as features (t-1, t-2, ...)
- **Rolling Statistics** -- moving average, rolling std, min, max
- **Cyclical Encoding** -- sin/cos encoding for cyclical patterns (hour, day of week)
