# Supervised Learning

> <- Back to [[Learning Types]]

Learning from labeled data by mapping inputs to known outputs. The most common ML paradigm, used whenever you have examples of correct answers.

## Key Properties

- [[Classification]]
- [[Regression]]

## How It Works

The model learns a function f(x) -> y from training examples where both x (input) and y (label) are provided. During inference, the model predicts y for unseen x.
