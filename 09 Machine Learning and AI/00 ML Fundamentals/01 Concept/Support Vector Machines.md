# Support Vector Machines

> <- Back to [[Classical ML Algorithms]]

Find the hyperplane that maximally separates classes. The kernel trick enables nonlinear decision boundaries by mapping to higher-dimensional spaces.

## Key Properties

- [[Kernel Trick]]
- [[Margin Maximization]]

## How It Works

SVM finds the decision boundary with the largest margin between classes. Support vectors are the data points closest to the boundary. Kernels (RBF, polynomial) enable nonlinear separation.
