# Numerical Features

> <- Back to [[Feature Engineering]]

Transforming numeric data for optimal model performance. Many algorithms are sensitive to feature scale and distribution.

## Techniques

- **Standardization** -- zero mean, unit variance (z-score)
- **Normalization** -- scale to [0, 1] range (min-max)
- **Binning** -- convert continuous to discrete ranges
- **Log Transforms** -- handle skewed distributions
