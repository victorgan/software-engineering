# Semi-Supervised Learning

> <- Back to [[Learning Types]]

Leveraging a small amount of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data. Practical when labeling is expensive but unlabeled data is abundant.

## Key Properties

- Combines supervised and unsupervised approaches
- Small labeled dataset + large unlabeled dataset
- Often uses self-training, co-training, or consistency regularization
