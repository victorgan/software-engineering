# Text Features

> <- Back to [[Feature Engineering]]

Converting text data into numeric representations for ML models.

## Techniques

- **TF-IDF** -- term frequency-inverse document frequency, sparse representation
- **Bag of Words** -- word count vectors, ignores order
- **N-grams** -- sequences of n consecutive words
- **Word Embeddings** -- dense vector representations (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
