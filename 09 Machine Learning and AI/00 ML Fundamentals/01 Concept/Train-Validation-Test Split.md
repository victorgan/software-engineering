# Train-Validation-Test Split

> <- Back to [[Model Evaluation]]

Dividing data into separate sets for training, tuning, and final evaluation. Prevents overfitting to evaluation data and gives honest performance estimates.

## Key Properties

- Holdout method (e.g., 70/15/15 split)
- Cross-validation: k-fold, stratified k-fold
- Time-series splits for temporal data

- [[Bias-Variance Tradeoff]] (validation reveals overfitting)
- [[Hyperparameter Tuning]] (uses validation set)
