# Feature Selection

> <- Back to [[Feature Engineering]]

Choosing the most relevant features to reduce dimensionality, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting.

## Techniques

- **Correlation Analysis** -- remove highly correlated or low-correlation features
- **Mutual Information** -- measure statistical dependence between feature and target
- **Recursive Feature Elimination** -- iteratively remove least important features
