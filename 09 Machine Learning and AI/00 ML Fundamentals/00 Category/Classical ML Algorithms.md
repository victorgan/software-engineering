# Classical ML Algorithms

**Back:** [[ML Fundamentals]]

Traditional machine learning algorithms that remain widely used in production systems. These algorithms are often more interpretable, faster to train, and require less data than deep learning approaches, making them the right choice for many practical problems.

## Concepts

- [[Linear Models]]
- [[Decision Trees]]
- [[Ensemble Methods]]
- [[Support Vector Machines]]
- [[K-Nearest Neighbors]]
- [[Naive Bayes]]
- [[Bayesian Methods]]
