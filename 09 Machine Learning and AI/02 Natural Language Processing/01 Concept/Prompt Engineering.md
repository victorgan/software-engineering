# Prompt Engineering

> <- Back to [[Large Language Models]]

Crafting inputs to get desired outputs from LLMs without modifying model weights. A critical skill for working with foundation models.

## Key Techniques

- **Zero-shot** -- task description only, no examples
- **Few-shot** -- provide examples in the prompt
- **Chain-of-Thought** -- instruct model to reason step by step
- **System Prompts** -- set behavior, persona, constraints
