# Foundation Models

> <- Back to [[Large Language Models]]

Large pretrained models that serve as the base for a wide range of downstream tasks. Trained on massive datasets with enormous compute, they develop general capabilities that can be specialized through prompting or fine-tuning.

## Key Models

- **GPT-4** -- OpenAI, multimodal, state-of-the-art reasoning
- **Claude** -- Anthropic, Constitutional AI, long context
- **LLaMA** -- Meta, open-weight, widely used for research and fine-tuning
- **Gemini** -- Google DeepMind, multimodal, long context
- **Mistral** -- Mistral AI, efficient open models, MoE architecture
