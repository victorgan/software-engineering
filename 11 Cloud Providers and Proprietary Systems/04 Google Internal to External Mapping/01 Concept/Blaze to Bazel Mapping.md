Blaze is Google's internal build system supporting hermetic builds, distributed caching, and remote execution across the monorepo. Bazel is the open-source version, sharing the same core architecture. Both use BUILD files and Starlark for build definitions. Bazel is widely adopted for large-scale polyglot projects.
