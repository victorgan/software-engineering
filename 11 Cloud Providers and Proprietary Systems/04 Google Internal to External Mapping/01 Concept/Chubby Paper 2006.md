**"The Chubby Lock Service for Loosely-Coupled Distributed Systems" (2006)** -- Burrows

Describes a distributed lock service providing coarse-grained locking and reliable (low-volume) storage. Used as a name service and configuration store across Google systems (Bigtable, GFS, MapReduce). Inspired Apache ZooKeeper, which serves a similar coordination role in the Hadoop ecosystem and beyond.
