Google's Dremel (2010 paper) introduced columnar storage with tree-shaped distributed execution for interactive queries on nested data. BigQuery is the externalized version on GCP. Apache Drill and Presto/Trino were directly inspired by the Dremel paper. BigQuery adds serverless scaling and ML capabilities.
