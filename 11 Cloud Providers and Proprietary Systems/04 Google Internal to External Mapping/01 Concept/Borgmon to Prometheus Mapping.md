Borgmon is Google's internal monitoring system for Borg workloads. Prometheus was directly inspired by Borgmon, sharing the pull-based model, time-series storage, and powerful query language (PromQL mirrors Borgmon's query language). Cloud Monitoring is the managed GCP equivalent backed by Monarch internally.
