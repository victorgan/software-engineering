Zanzibar (2019 paper) is Google's global authorization system using relationship-based access control (ReBAC). Checks billions of authorization decisions per second. Inspired SpiceDB (Authzed), OpenFGA (Auth0/Okta), and Ory Keto. All model permissions as relationships between objects and subjects in a graph.
