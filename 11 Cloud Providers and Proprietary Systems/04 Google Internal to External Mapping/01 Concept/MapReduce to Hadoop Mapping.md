Google's MapReduce (2004 paper) defined the paradigm for distributed batch data processing. Hadoop MapReduce was directly inspired by the paper and became the industry standard. Google internally superseded MapReduce with FlumeJava/Flume. No direct GCP equivalent as the paradigm evolved to Dataflow/Beam.
