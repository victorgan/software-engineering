# FlumeJava to Beam Mapping

> <- Back to [[Data Systems Mapping]]

| | Google Internal | Open Source | GCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| System | FlumeJava / Flume | Apache Beam | Dataflow |
| Concept | Data pipelines | Unified batch/stream API | Managed data pipelines |

FlumeJava was Google's successor to MapReduce — pipeline-based data processing with optimized execution plans. Apache Beam is the open-source equivalent providing a unified API for both batch and stream processing. Dataflow is the managed GCP service that runs Beam pipelines.
