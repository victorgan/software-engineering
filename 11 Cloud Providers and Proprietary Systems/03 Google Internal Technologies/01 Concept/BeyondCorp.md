> <- Back to [[Google Security and Identity]]

Google's zero-trust security model. No VPN required — all access is identity-based regardless of network location. Every request is authenticated and authorized based on user identity, device state, and context. Inspired the industry-wide zero-trust movement. Externalized as BeyondCorp Enterprise (GCP). Paper: "BeyondCorp: A New Approach to Enterprise Security" (2014).
