# Cloud Spanner

> <- Back to [[GCP Databases]]

Globally distributed relational database with strong consistency, horizontal scaling, and SQL support. Uses TrueTime (atomic clocks + GPS) for global consistency. Originally built for Google internally. No direct AWS equivalent (closest: Aurora Global Database). Inspired CockroachDB and YugabyteDB.
