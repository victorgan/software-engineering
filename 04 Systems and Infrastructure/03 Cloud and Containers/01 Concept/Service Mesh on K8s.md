# Service Mesh on K8s

> <- Back to [[Container Orchestration]]

Deploying a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) in Kubernetes using sidecar injection. A proxy container (Envoy) is automatically injected into every pod, intercepting all network traffic. Provides mutual TLS, traffic management, observability, and resilience without application code changes.

## Key Properties

- [[Sidecar Injection]]
- [[Istio and Linkerd]]
- [[Mesh Observability]]
