# Container Registries

> <- Back to [[Containerization]]

Repositories for storing and distributing container images. Docker Hub is the default public registry. Cloud providers offer managed registries: ECR (AWS), GCR/Artifact Registry (GCP), ACR (Azure). GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) integrates with GitHub Actions. Registries support tagging, versioning, and access control.
