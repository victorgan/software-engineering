# Operators

> <- Back to [[Container Orchestration]]

Custom controllers that extend Kubernetes to manage complex, stateful applications. Operators use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define new resource types and custom controllers to implement the operational logic (backup, scaling, upgrades). Examples: PostgreSQL operator, Prometheus operator.
