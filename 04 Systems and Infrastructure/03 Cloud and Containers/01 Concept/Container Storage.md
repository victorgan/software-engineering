# Container Storage

> <- Back to [[Containerization]]

Managing persistent data in ephemeral containers. Volumes are managed by Docker and persist beyond container lifecycle. Bind mounts map host directories into containers. tmpfs mounts are in-memory only. Container filesystems are ephemeral — data is lost when the container is removed.

## Key Properties

- [[Docker Volumes]]
