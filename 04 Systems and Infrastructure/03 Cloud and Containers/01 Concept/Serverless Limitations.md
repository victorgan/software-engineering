# Serverless Limitations

> <- Back to [[Serverless]]

Constraints of the serverless model: execution time limits (15 min for Lambda), stateless execution (no local state between invocations), cold start latency, vendor lock-in (proprietary APIs and integrations), limited control over runtime environment, and difficulty with long-running or stateful workloads.

## Key Properties

- [[Execution Time Limits]]
- [[Stateless Execution]]
- [[Vendor Lock-In]]

## Related

- [[Cold Starts]] (a key performance limitation)
- [[Kubernetes]] (alternative for workloads that do not fit serverless)
