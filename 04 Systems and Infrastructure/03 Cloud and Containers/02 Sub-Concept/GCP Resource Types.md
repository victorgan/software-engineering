# GCP Resource Types

> <- Back to [[Google Cloud Deployment Manager]]

Deployment Manager supports GCP resource types following the pattern {service}.{version}.{resource} (e.g., compute.v1.instance, storage.v1.bucket). Type providers can extend support to third-party APIs. The available resource types map directly to the GCP REST API resources.
