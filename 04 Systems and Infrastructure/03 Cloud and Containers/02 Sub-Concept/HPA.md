> <- Back to [[K8s Scaling]]

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler — automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on observed metrics. Default metric is CPU utilization; supports memory, custom metrics (requests per second), and external metrics (queue depth). Scales up quickly to handle load spikes and scales down gradually to save resources.
