# Playbooks

> <- Back to [[Ansible]]

YAML files that define a set of tasks to execute on target hosts. Playbooks specify which hosts to target (inventory), what tasks to run (modules), and in what order. Tasks are executed sequentially, with handlers triggered by notifications (e.g., restart Nginx after config change).
