# Agentless Architecture

> <- Back to [[Ansible]]

Ansible does not require installing software on managed hosts — it connects via SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows) and executes tasks remotely. This simplifies setup and reduces the maintenance burden compared to agent-based tools (Puppet, Chef). Only the control node needs Ansible installed.
