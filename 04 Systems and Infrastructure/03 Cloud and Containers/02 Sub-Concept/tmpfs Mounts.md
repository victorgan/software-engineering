# tmpfs Mounts

> <- Back to [[Container Storage]]

In-memory filesystem mounts that do not persist to disk. Data is lost when the container stops. Useful for sensitive data that should not be written to disk (secrets, temporary files) or for performance-critical temporary storage. Limited by available memory.
