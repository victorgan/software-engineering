# StorageClasses

> <- Back to [[K8s Storage]]

Define different tiers/types of storage (SSD, HDD, network-attached) with specific provisioners and parameters. When a PVC references a StorageClass, the volume is dynamically provisioned. Examples: AWS gp3, GCE pd-ssd, Azure managed-premium. Enables self-service storage provisioning.
