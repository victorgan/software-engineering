# Edge Caching

> <- Back to [[CDN]]

Storing copies of content on servers geographically close to end users. When a user requests content, the nearest edge server (PoP — Point of Presence) serves it, reducing latency from hundreds of milliseconds to single-digit milliseconds. Cache hits bypass the origin server entirely.

## Key Properties

- [[Geographic Distribution]]
- [[Cache Hit Ratio]]
- [[PoP Selection]]

- [[Origin Shield]] (intermediate cache between edge and origin)
- [[Cache Invalidation]] (keeping edge caches fresh)
