# Record Types

> <- Back to [[DNS]]

Different DNS record types serve different purposes. A maps a domain to an IPv4 address. AAAA maps to IPv6. CNAME creates an alias to another domain. MX specifies mail servers. TXT stores arbitrary text (used for SPF, DKIM, domain verification). NS delegates to name servers. SRV specifies service locations. SOA contains zone authority information.
