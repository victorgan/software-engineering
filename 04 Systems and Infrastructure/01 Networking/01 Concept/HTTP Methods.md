# HTTP Methods

> <- Back to [[HTTP]]

Verbs that indicate the desired action on a resource. GET retrieves data (safe, idempotent). POST creates resources (not idempotent). PUT replaces a resource entirely (idempotent). PATCH partially updates. DELETE removes. OPTIONS queries supported methods (used in CORS preflight). HEAD is like GET but returns only headers.

## Key Properties

- [[Safe and Idempotent Methods]]
- [[CRUD Mapping]]
- [[CORS Preflight]]
