# VPN Tunneling

> <- Back to [[NAT Firewalls and VPNs]]

Creating an encrypted tunnel between two endpoints over the public internet. Site-to-site VPNs connect networks; remote access VPNs connect individual users. WireGuard is a modern, simple, high-performance VPN protocol. IPSec and OpenVPN are older alternatives. VPNs enable secure access to private networks.
