# DNS-over-TLS

> <- Back to [[DNS Security]]

DoT encrypts DNS queries using TLS on port 853. Unlike DoH, it uses a dedicated port, making it easy to identify and block (which can be either an advantage or disadvantage). Simpler than DoH since it does not involve HTTP framing. Supported by Android and many DNS resolvers.
