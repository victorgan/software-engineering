# Purge Mechanisms

Methods to remove content from CDN caches: single URL purge (remove one specific resource), wildcard purge (remove all matching a pattern), and full purge (clear everything). Purge propagation time varies by provider — Fastly offers instant purging, others may take seconds to minutes.
