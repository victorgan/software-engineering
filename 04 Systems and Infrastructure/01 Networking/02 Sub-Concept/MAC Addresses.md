# MAC Addresses

> <- Back to [[Data Link Layer]]

48-bit hardware addresses (e.g., AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF) burned into network interface cards. Used for local network delivery — switches forward frames based on MAC addresses. Globally unique (assigned by manufacturer) but can be spoofed. Not routable beyond the local network segment.
