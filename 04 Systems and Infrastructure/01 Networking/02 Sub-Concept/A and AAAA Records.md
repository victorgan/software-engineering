# A and AAAA Records

> <- Back to [[Record Types]]

A records map a domain name to an IPv4 address (e.g., example.com -> 93.184.216.34). AAAA records map to an IPv6 address (e.g., example.com -> 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946). Multiple A/AAAA records can provide round-robin DNS load balancing.
