# Cache Tags

> <- Back to [[Cache Invalidation]]

Labels attached to cached responses (via Surrogate-Key or Cache-Tag headers) that enable group invalidation. For example, tag all product pages with "product-123" and purge all pages for that product at once when it changes. More precise than wildcard purging, supported by Fastly, Cloudflare, and others.
