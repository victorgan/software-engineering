# DNSSEC

> <- Back to [[DNS Security]]

DNS Security Extensions add cryptographic signatures to DNS records, allowing resolvers to verify that responses have not been tampered with. Uses a chain of trust from the root zone down. Protects against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning but does not encrypt queries (still visible to eavesdroppers).
