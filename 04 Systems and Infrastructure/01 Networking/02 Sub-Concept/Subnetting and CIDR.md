# Subnetting and CIDR

> <- Back to [[Network Layer]]

Subnetting divides a network into smaller subnetworks using subnet masks. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24) specifies the network prefix length, replacing the rigid Class A/B/C system. A /24 network has 256 addresses (254 usable), /16 has 65,536, etc.
