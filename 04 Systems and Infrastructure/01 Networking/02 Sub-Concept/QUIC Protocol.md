> <- Back to [[Transport Layer]]

A modern transport protocol built on UDP with built-in TLS 1.3 encryption. Supports multiplexed streams without head-of-line blocking, 0-RTT connection establishment, and connection migration across network changes. Developed by Google, standardized as RFC 9000. Used by HTTP/3.
