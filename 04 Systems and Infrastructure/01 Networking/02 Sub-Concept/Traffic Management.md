# Traffic Management

> <- Back to [[Service Mesh]]

Service mesh features for controlling traffic flow: canary deployments (route a percentage of traffic to a new version), traffic shifting (gradual rollout), fault injection (test resilience), request mirroring (shadow traffic), and circuit breaking. Configured declaratively without code changes.
