# Bidirectional Streaming

> <- Back to [[gRPC]]

gRPC supports four communication patterns: unary (single request/response), server streaming (one request, stream of responses), client streaming (stream of requests, one response), and bidirectional streaming (both sides stream independently). Built on HTTP/2 streams for efficient multiplexing.
