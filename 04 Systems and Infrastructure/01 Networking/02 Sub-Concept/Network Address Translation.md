# Network Address Translation

> <- Back to [[NAT Firewalls and VPNs]]

NAT maps private IP addresses (10.x, 192.168.x) to public IP addresses, allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP. Port-based NAT (PAT/NAPT) uses source port numbers to distinguish connections. NAT breaks end-to-end connectivity and complicates peer-to-peer protocols.
