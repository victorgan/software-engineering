# Intermediate Cache Layer

> <- Back to [[Origin Shield]]

The origin shield sits between edge PoPs and the origin server, consolidating cache misses from multiple edges into fewer requests to the origin. Instead of N edge servers each making an origin request on a cache miss, only the shield makes one request and distributes the response to all requesting edges.
