# Bandwidth and Throughput

> <- Back to [[Physical Layer]]

Bandwidth is the maximum data rate a link can support (theoretical capacity). Throughput is the actual data rate achieved in practice, always less than bandwidth due to overhead, congestion, and protocol inefficiencies. Measured in bits per second (bps, Mbps, Gbps).
