# Routing

> <- Back to [[Network Layer]]

The process of selecting paths for packets across networks. Routers maintain routing tables and use protocols like OSPF (link-state), BGP (path-vector, inter-domain), and RIP (distance-vector) to discover and share routes. Routing decisions are made hop-by-hop based on destination IP.
