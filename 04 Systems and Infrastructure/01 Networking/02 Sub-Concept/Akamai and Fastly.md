Akamai is the oldest and largest CDN, serving ~30% of global internet traffic, favored by enterprises for its scale and security features. Fastly differentiates with real-time purging (< 150ms globally), programmable edge computing (Compute@Edge using Wasm), and developer-friendly APIs. Both target enterprise workloads.
