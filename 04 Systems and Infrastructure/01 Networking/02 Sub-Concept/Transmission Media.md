# Transmission Media

> <- Back to [[Physical Layer]]

The physical medium over which data is transmitted. Copper cables (Cat5e, Cat6) carry electrical signals; fiber optic cables carry light pulses with higher bandwidth and longer range; wireless uses radio waves (Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth). Medium choice affects bandwidth, latency, distance, and cost.
