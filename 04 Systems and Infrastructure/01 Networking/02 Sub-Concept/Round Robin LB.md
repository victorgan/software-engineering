# Round Robin LB

> <- Back to [[Load Balancing Algorithms]]

Distributes requests to backend servers in sequential order. Simple and effective when servers have equal capacity and requests have similar cost. Weighted round robin assigns proportional traffic based on server capacity (e.g., a 2x powerful server gets 2x requests).
