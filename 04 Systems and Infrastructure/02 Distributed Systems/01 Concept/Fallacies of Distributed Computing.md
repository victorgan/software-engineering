# Fallacies of Distributed Computing

> <- Back to [[Fundamental Concepts]]

Eight false assumptions developers make about networks: (1) The network is reliable, (2) Latency is zero, (3) Bandwidth is infinite, (4) The network is secure, (5) Topology doesn't change, (6) There is one administrator, (7) Transport cost is zero, (8) The network is homogeneous. Every distributed system must account for these realities.

## Key Properties

- [[Network Unreliability]]
- [[Latency Reality]]
- [[Bandwidth Constraints]]
