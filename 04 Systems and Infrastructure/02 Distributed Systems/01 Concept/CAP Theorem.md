# CAP Theorem

> <- Back to [[Fundamental Concepts]]

States that a distributed system can provide at most two of three guarantees simultaneously: Consistency (all nodes see the same data), Availability (every request gets a response), and Partition Tolerance (system works despite network partitions). Since partitions are inevitable, the practical choice is between CP and AP systems.

## Key Properties

- [[AP Systems]]
- [[Partition Tolerance]]
