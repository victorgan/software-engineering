# PBFT Algorithm

> <- Back to [[Byzantine Fault Tolerance]]

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance — the first efficient BFT algorithm for asynchronous systems. Uses a three-phase protocol (pre-prepare, prepare, commit) to reach agreement. Requires 3f+1 nodes to tolerate f Byzantine faults. O(n^2) message complexity limits scalability.
