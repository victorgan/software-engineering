# Partitioning and Sharding

**Back:** [[Distributed Systems]]

Dividing data across multiple nodes so that each node is responsible for a subset. Partitioning enables horizontal scaling beyond the capacity of a single machine but introduces complexity around cross-partition queries and data rebalancing.

## Concepts

- [[Range-Based Partitioning]]
- [[Hash-Based Partitioning]]
- [[Consistent Hashing]]
- [[Cross-Partition Queries]]
- [[Rebalancing]]
