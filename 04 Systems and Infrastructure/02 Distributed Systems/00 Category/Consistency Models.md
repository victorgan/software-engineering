# Consistency Models

**Back:** [[Distributed Systems]]

Different guarantees about how and when updates become visible to readers across distributed replicas. Stronger consistency is easier to reason about but harder to achieve with high availability and performance. Weaker consistency allows better performance but complicates application logic.

## Concepts

- [[Strong Consistency]]
- [[Sequential Consistency]]
- [[Causal Consistency]]
- [[Eventual Consistency]]
- [[Read-Your-Writes]]
