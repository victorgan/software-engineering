# Scheduling Algorithms

> <- Back to [[CPU Scheduling]]

Different strategies for deciding which process gets CPU time next. Each algorithm makes different tradeoffs between throughput, latency, fairness, and complexity.

## Key Properties

- [[FIFO Scheduling]]
- [[Shortest Job First]]
- [[Round Robin]]
- [[Priority Scheduling]]
- [[Multilevel Feedback Queue]]

## Related

- [[Preemptive vs Cooperative]] (algorithms can be either)
- [[Real-Time Scheduling]] (specialized algorithms for time-critical tasks)
