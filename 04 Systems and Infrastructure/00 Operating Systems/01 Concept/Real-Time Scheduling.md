# Real-Time Scheduling

> <- Back to [[CPU Scheduling]]

Scheduling for systems with strict timing constraints. Hard real-time systems must meet every deadline (medical devices, avionics), while soft real-time systems tolerate occasional misses (video playback, gaming). Common algorithms include rate monotonic and Earliest Deadline First (EDF).

## Key Properties

- [[Hard vs Soft Real-Time]]
- [[Rate Monotonic Scheduling]]
- [[Earliest Deadline First]]
