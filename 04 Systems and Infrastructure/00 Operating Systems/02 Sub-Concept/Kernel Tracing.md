# Kernel Tracing

> <- Back to [[eBPF]]

eBPF programs can attach to kernel tracepoints, kprobes, and uprobes to observe system behavior with minimal overhead. Tools like bpftrace, BCC, and bpftool enable deep visibility into kernel operations, system calls, and application behavior without modifying the kernel or application code.
