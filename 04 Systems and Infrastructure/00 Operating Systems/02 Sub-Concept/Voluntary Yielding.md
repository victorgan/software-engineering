# Voluntary Yielding

> <- Back to [[Preemptive vs Cooperative]]

In cooperative scheduling, processes must explicitly yield control to allow others to run. Simple to implement but vulnerable to misbehaving processes that never yield. Used in early operating systems (Windows 3.x) and modern user-space schedulers (coroutines, green threads).
