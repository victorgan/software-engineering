# Ceph and GlusterFS

> <- Back to [[Distributed File Systems]]

Modern distributed storage systems. Ceph provides object, block, and file storage with no single point of failure, using CRUSH algorithm for data placement. GlusterFS is a scalable network file system that aggregates storage from multiple servers. Both are open-source alternatives to proprietary storage.
