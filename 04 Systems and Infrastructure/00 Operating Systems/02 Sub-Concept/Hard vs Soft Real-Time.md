# Hard vs Soft Real-Time

> <- Back to [[Real-Time Scheduling]]

Hard real-time systems have absolute deadlines where a miss is a system failure (pacemakers, flight control). Soft real-time systems have deadlines where occasional misses degrade quality but are tolerable (video streaming, gaming). The distinction drives the choice of scheduling algorithm and OS design.
