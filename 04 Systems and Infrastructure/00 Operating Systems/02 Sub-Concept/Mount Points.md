# Mount Points

> <- Back to [[VFS (Virtual File System)]]

Directories where different file systems are attached to the unified directory tree. Mounting makes the contents of a device or network share accessible at a specific path. Each mount point can use a different file system type (ext4, NFS, tmpfs, etc.).
