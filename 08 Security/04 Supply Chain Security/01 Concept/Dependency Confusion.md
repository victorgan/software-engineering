# Dependency Confusion

> <- Back to [[Software Supply Chain]]

An attack where a private package name is registered on a public registry with a higher version number. Package managers that check public registries first may install the attacker's version instead of the internal one. Mitigated by scoped registries and namespace reservation.

## Key Properties

- [[Public vs Private Registry Priority]]
- [[Scoped Registries]]
- [[Namespace Reservation]]
