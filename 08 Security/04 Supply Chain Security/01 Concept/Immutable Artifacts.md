# Immutable Artifacts

> <- Back to [[CI-CD Security]]

Building an artifact once and promoting it through environments (dev, staging, production) without rebuilding. Immutable artifacts ensure that what was tested is exactly what is deployed. Rebuilding introduces risk of different dependencies, build tools, or compromised build environments.

## Key Properties

- [[Build Once Deploy Many]]
- [[Artifact Promotion]]
- [[Deterministic Builds]]
