# Lock Files

> <- Back to [[Dependency Pinning]]

Files that record the exact versions of all direct and transitive dependencies resolved during installation (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, Pipfile.lock, go.sum, Cargo.lock). Lock files must be committed to version control to ensure reproducible builds across environments.
