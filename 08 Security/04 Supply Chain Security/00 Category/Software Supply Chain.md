# Software Supply Chain

**Back:** [[Supply Chain Security]]

The chain of dependencies, build tools, and distribution channels that comprise modern software. Supply chain attacks target vulnerabilities in dependencies, build systems, and package registries. Protection requires scanning, pinning, signing, and comprehensive visibility into what your software contains.

## Concepts

- [[Dependency Vulnerabilities]]
- [[Dependency Pinning]]
- [[SLSA Framework]]
- [[SBOM]]
- [[Artifact Signing]]
- [[Typosquatting]]
