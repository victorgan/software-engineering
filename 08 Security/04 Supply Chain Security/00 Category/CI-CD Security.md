# CI-CD Security

**Back:** [[Supply Chain Security]]

Securing the build and deployment pipeline against compromise. CI/CD systems have privileged access to production and are high-value targets. Pipeline hardening, short-lived credentials, code signing, and immutable artifacts protect the delivery chain.

## Concepts

- [[Pipeline Hardening]]
- [[OIDC for Cloud Auth]]
- [[Code Signing]]
- [[Immutable Artifacts]]
