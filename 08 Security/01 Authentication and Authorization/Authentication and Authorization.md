# Authentication and Authorization

**Back:** [[08 - Security MOC]]

Authentication verifies identity (who are you?), while authorization determines access (what can you do?). Together they form the foundation of access control, spanning from password-based login and OAuth 2.0 to role-based and attribute-based access control policies.
