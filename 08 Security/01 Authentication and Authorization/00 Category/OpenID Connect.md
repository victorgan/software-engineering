# OpenID Connect

**Back:** [[Authentication and Authorization]]

An identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that adds authentication. While OAuth 2.0 handles authorization (what can you access), OIDC adds identity (who are you) through ID tokens, UserInfo endpoints, and standardized discovery.

## Concepts

- [[ID Token]]
- [[UserInfo Endpoint]]
