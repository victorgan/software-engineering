# Refresh Tokens

> <- Back to [[OAuth 2.0]]

Long-lived tokens used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate. Refresh tokens should be stored securely, rotated on use (one-time use), and revocable. They enable long user sessions while keeping access tokens short-lived.

## Key Properties

- [[Token Rotation]]
- [[Secure Storage]]
- [[Revocation Support]]
