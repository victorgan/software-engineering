# Hash Properties

> <- Back to [[Hashing]]

The essential properties of cryptographic hash functions: collision resistance (infeasible to find two inputs with the same output), pre-image resistance (infeasible to reverse the hash), and the avalanche effect (small input changes produce drastically different outputs).

## Key Properties

- [[Collision Resistance]]
- [[Pre-Image Resistance]]
