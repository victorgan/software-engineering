# Certificate Authorities

> <- Back to [[PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)]]

Trusted entities that issue, sign, and revoke digital certificates. Root CAs are self-signed and embedded in trust stores; intermediate CAs are signed by root CAs. The CA hierarchy establishes the chain of trust that enables TLS and other PKI-dependent systems.
