# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

> <- Back to [[Asymmetric Encryption]]

Asymmetric encryption based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC provides the same security as RSA with much smaller keys (256-bit ECC roughly equals 3072-bit RSA). Ed25519 and P-256 are the most commonly used curves.

## Key Properties

- [[Smaller Key Sizes]]
- [[Ed25519 Curve]]
- [[P-256 Curve]]
