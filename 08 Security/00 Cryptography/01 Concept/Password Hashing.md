# Password Hashing

> <- Back to [[Hashing]]

Specialized hash functions designed for password storage: bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2. Unlike general-purpose hashes, password hashing functions are intentionally slow (to resist brute-force attacks), salted (to prevent rainbow table attacks), and adaptive (work factor can increase over time).
