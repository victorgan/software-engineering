# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

> <- Back to [[Asymmetric Encryption]]

A protocol for establishing a shared secret over an insecure channel without transmitting the secret itself. Two parties exchange public values and independently compute the same shared secret. Forms the basis of key exchange in TLS and many other protocols.

## Key Properties

- [[Shared Secret Derivation]]
- [[Forward Secrecy]]
- [[ECDHE (Ephemeral Elliptic Curve DH)]]
