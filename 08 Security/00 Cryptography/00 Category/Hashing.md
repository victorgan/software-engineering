# Hashing

**Back:** [[Cryptography]]

One-way functions that produce fixed-size output from arbitrary input. Hash functions are deterministic, collision-resistant, and exhibit the avalanche effect (small input changes produce drastically different outputs). Used for password storage, data integrity, and digital signatures.
