# Digital Signatures

**Back:** [[Cryptography]]

Cryptographic proofs of authenticity and integrity using private keys. The signer hashes a message and signs the hash with their private key; anyone can verify the signature using the signer's public key. Used for code signing, JWTs, certificates, and document signing.
