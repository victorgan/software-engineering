# Asymmetric Encryption

**Back:** [[Cryptography]]

Encryption using a key pair: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Asymmetric encryption enables secure communication without pre-shared secrets, forming the basis for TLS, SSH, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols.
