# Salt and Work Factor

> <- Back to [[Password Hashing]]

Salts are random values prepended to passwords before hashing, ensuring identical passwords produce different hashes and defeating rainbow table attacks. Work factor (cost parameter) controls how slow the hash function is, and should be increased over time as hardware gets faster.
