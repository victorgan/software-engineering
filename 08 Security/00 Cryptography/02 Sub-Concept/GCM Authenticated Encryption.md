# GCM Authenticated Encryption

> <- Back to [[Block Cipher Modes]]

Galois/Counter Mode combines CTR mode encryption with a Galois field MAC for authentication. GCM provides both confidentiality and integrity in a single operation (AEAD - Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data), making it the preferred mode for AES in most applications.
