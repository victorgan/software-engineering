# Runtime Security

> <- Back to [[Container Security]]

Securing containers during execution: read-only filesystems, non-root users, seccomp profiles (restricting system calls), and AppArmor/SELinux profiles (mandatory access control). Runtime security limits what a compromised container can do.

## Key Properties

- [[Read-Only Filesystems]]
- [[Non-Root Execution]]
