# CVSS Scoring

> <- Back to [[CVE Tracking]]

Common Vulnerability Scoring System rates vulnerability severity from 0.0-10.0: None (0.0), Low (0.1-3.9), Medium (4.0-6.9), High (7.0-8.9), Critical (9.0-10.0). CVSS considers attack vector, complexity, privileges required, user interaction, and impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
