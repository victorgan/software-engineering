# Microservices Challenges

> <- Back to [[Microservices]]

Distributed transactions, debugging, operational complexity, and data consistency. Microservices trade development complexity for operational complexity. Network failures, distributed tracing, and eventual consistency are inherent challenges.

## Key Properties

- [[Distributed Debugging]]
- [[Operational Overhead]]
- [[Data Consistency Challenges]]
