# Result and Option Types

> <- Back to [[Modern and Functional Patterns]]

Error handling without exceptions. Explicit types that represent either success/failure (Result) or presence/absence (Option/Maybe). Force callers to handle error cases at compile time, making error handling explicit and exhaustive. Common in Rust, Haskell, and modern TypeScript.
