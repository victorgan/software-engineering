# Chain of Responsibility

> <- Back to [[Behavioral Patterns]]

Pass requests along a chain of handlers (middleware). Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until one handles it.

## Key Properties

- [[Handler Chain]]
- [[Request Propagation]]
- [[Default Handling]]

## Related

- [[Middleware Pipeline]] (modern application)
- [[Decorator]] (similar chaining structure)
- [[Command]] (encapsulated requests)
