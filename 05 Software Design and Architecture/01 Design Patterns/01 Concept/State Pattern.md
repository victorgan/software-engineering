# State Pattern

> <- Back to [[Behavioral Patterns]]

Object behavior changes based on internal state. Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class, replacing conditional logic with polymorphic state objects.

## Key Properties

- [[State Transitions]]
- [[State Interface]]
- [[Context Delegation]]

## Related

- [[Strategy]] (similar structure, different intent)
- [[Finite State Machines]] (mathematical model)
