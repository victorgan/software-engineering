# Bridge

> <- Back to [[Structural Patterns]]

Decouple abstraction from implementation. Separate an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Unlike adapter (which is applied after design), bridge is designed upfront.

## Key Properties

- [[Abstraction and Implementor]]
- [[Independent Variation]]
- [[Platform Abstraction]]

## Related

- [[Adapter]] (retrofitted, bridge is designed upfront)
- [[Strategy]] (similar structure, different intent)
