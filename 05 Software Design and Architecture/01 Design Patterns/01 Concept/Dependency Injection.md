# Dependency Injection

> <- Back to [[Modern and Functional Patterns]]

Provide dependencies externally, inversion of control. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies, they are passed in from outside (constructor, setter, or interface injection). Enables testability, flexibility, and adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle.

## Key Properties

- [[Constructor Injection]]
- [[IoC Containers]]
- [[Service Locator vs DI]]

## Related

- [[Dependency Inversion Principle]] (the principle DI implements)
- [[Singleton]] (DI replaces singletons)
