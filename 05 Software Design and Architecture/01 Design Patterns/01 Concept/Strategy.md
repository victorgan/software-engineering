# Strategy

> <- Back to [[Behavioral Patterns]]

Interchangeable algorithms, runtime selection. Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Key Properties

- [[Algorithm Encapsulation]]
- [[Context and Strategy]]
- [[Runtime Selection]]

## Related

- [[State Pattern]] (similar structure, different intent)
- [[Template Method]] (inversion: subclass vs delegation)
- [[Bridge]] (similar structure at architectural level)
