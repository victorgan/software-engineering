# Bounded Contexts

> <- Back to [[Strategic Design]]

An explicit boundary where a domain model applies. Within a bounded context, terms have precise meanings and the model is internally consistent. Different bounded contexts can use the same term to mean different things (e.g., "Customer" in billing vs shipping).
