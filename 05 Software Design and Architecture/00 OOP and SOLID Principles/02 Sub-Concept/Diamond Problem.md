# Diamond Problem

> <- Back to [[Inheritance]]

An ambiguity that arises in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common ancestor. Different languages resolve this differently: C++ uses virtual inheritance, Python uses MRO (Method Resolution Order), and many languages simply disallow multiple inheritance.
