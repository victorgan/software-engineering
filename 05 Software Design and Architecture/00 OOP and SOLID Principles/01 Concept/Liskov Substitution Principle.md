# Liskov Substitution Principle

> <- Back to [[SOLID Principles]]

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. If a program uses a base class, it should be able to use any subclass without knowing the difference and without breaking correctness.

## Key Properties

- [[Behavioral Subtyping]]
- [[Preconditions and Postconditions]]
- [[Invariant Preservation]]

## Related

- [[Inheritance]] (LSP governs proper use)
- [[Polymorphism]] (depends on LSP for correctness)
