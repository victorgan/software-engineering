# Separation of Concerns

> <- Back to [[Other Design Principles]]

Each module addresses a distinct concern. Separate a program into distinct sections where each section addresses a specific piece of functionality. This reduces complexity and improves maintainability.

## Key Properties

- [[Modular Decomposition]]
- [[Cross-Cutting Concerns]]

## Related

- [[Single Responsibility Principle]] (class-level application)
- [[Layered Architecture]] (architectural application)
