# Polymorphism

> <- Back to [[Core OOP Concepts]]

Same interface, different implementations. Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly through a shared interface, enabling extensibility and reducing conditional logic.

## Key Properties

- [[Compile-Time Polymorphism]]
- [[Runtime Polymorphism]]
- [[Duck Typing]]

## Related

- [[Inheritance]] (enables polymorphism)
- [[Strategy]] (pattern leveraging polymorphism)
- [[Open-Closed Principle]] (achieved through polymorphism)
