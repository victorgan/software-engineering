# Coupling vs Autonomy

> <- Back to [[Fundamental Tradeoffs]]

Monoliths are coupled but consistent; microservices are autonomous but operationally complex. Tight coupling makes changes easier within a module but harder across modules. Loose coupling enables independent evolution but requires careful interface design.
