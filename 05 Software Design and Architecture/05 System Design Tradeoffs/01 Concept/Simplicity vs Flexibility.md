# Simplicity vs Flexibility

> <- Back to [[Fundamental Tradeoffs]]

Generic systems handle more cases but are harder to understand and maintain. Simple, focused solutions are easier to build, debug, and operate, but may need replacement when requirements change significantly.

## Key Properties

- [[Accidental Complexity]]
- [[Essential Complexity]]
- [[Generalization Cost]]

## Related

- [[KISS]] (favor simplicity)
- [[YAGNI]] (don't over-generalize)
