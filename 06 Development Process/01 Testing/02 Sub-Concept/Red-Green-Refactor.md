# Red-Green-Refactor

> <- Back to [[Test-Driven Development]]

The TDD cycle: (1) Write a failing test (Red), (2) Write the simplest code that passes (Green), (3) Improve the code while keeping tests green (Refactor). Each cycle is short — minutes, not hours. The discipline prevents over-engineering.
