# Testing Pyramid

**Back:** [[Testing]]

A model for balancing the quantity and types of tests. Many fast unit tests at the base, fewer integration tests in the middle, and few slow E2E tests at the top. The trophy model shifts emphasis toward more integration tests.

## Concepts

- [[Unit Tests]]
- [[Integration Tests]]
- [[End-to-End Tests]]
- [[Trophy Model]]
