> <- Back to [[Test Doubles]]

Verify interactions — that specific methods were called with specific arguments. Mocks set expectations before the test runs and verify them afterward. Overuse can lead to brittle tests coupled to implementation details.

## Key Properties

- [[Interaction Verification]]
- [[Expectation Setting]]
- [[Brittleness Risk]]

## Related

- [[Stubs]] (return values, no verification)
- [[Spies]] (record without changing behavior)
