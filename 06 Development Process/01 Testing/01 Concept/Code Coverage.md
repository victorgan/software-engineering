# Code Coverage

> <- Back to [[Test Strategy]]

Measurement of how much code is exercised by tests. Line, branch, and condition coverage are common metrics. Coverage is useful as a metric (identifying untested areas) but misleading as a goal (high coverage does not guarantee quality).

## Key Properties

- [[Line Coverage]]
- [[Branch Coverage]]
- [[Coverage as Metric Not Goal]]

## Related

- [[Mutation Testing]] (stronger quality signal)
