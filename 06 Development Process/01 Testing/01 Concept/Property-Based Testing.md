# Property-Based Testing

> <- Back to [[Advanced Testing Techniques]]

Generate random inputs, verify properties hold for all of them. Instead of testing specific examples, define properties that should always be true (Hypothesis for Python, QuickCheck for Haskell, fast-check for JS). Discovers edge cases humans would not think of.
