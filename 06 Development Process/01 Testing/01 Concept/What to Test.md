# What to Test

> <- Back to [[Test Strategy]]

Business logic, edge cases, error paths — not implementation details. Test behavior, not implementation. Focus tests on what the code does, not how it does it. Avoid testing framework internals, getters/setters, or private methods.

## Key Properties

- [[Behavior Over Implementation]]
- [[Edge Cases]]
- [[Error Paths]]

## Related

- [[Test Maintenance]] (testing behavior reduces maintenance)
