> <- Back to [[Types of Technical Debt]]

Martin Fowler's 2x2 matrix: Deliberate-Prudent ("We must ship now and deal with consequences"), Deliberate-Reckless ("We don't have time for design"), Inadvertent-Prudent ("Now we know how we should have done it"), Inadvertent-Reckless ("What's layering?"). Each type warrants different responses.
