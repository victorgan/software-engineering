# Pull System

> <- Back to [[Kanban]]

New work is pulled when capacity is available, rather than pushed by a schedule or manager. WIP limits enforce this: a developer can only pull new work when their current column is below its limit. Prevents overloading.

## Key Properties

- [[Demand-Driven Work]]
- [[WIP Enforcement]]
- [[Capacity-Based Flow]]
