# Four Values

> <- Back to [[Agile Manifesto]]

(1) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. (2) Working software over comprehensive documentation. (3) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. (4) Responding to change over following a plan. The items on the right have value, but the items on the left are valued more.
